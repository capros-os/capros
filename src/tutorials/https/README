This tutorial does several things:

1. It serves a web page with dynamic content.
2. It serves a URL where you may download the target system's security
   certificate.
3. It serves a URL where you may upload a program that will be executed
   in a confined environment. 
All URLs take the form of web-keys; see http://waterken.sourceforge.net/web-key.

To run this tutorial:

You must have first copied the network configuration files (tutorials/config),
customized them, and installed them using "make install".

You must have set up a test system with a disk, and you must
define an environment variable CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION as described elsewhere.

If desired, customize the TCP ports and Swiss numbers used
by editing main/test.h.
You can generate new random Swiss numbers by typing:
   cd main
   ./genswiss

Then from tutorials/https, type:
    make p
This will build the tutorial and copy it to the target system.
Then boot CapROS.

You can connect to the web page from a browser using the URL
documented in test.h.
You will need to accept the self-signed certificate the first time.

You can upload a confined program using the instructions on the web page. 

A sample program that you can upload is built in 
tutorials/https/confined/BUILD/*/confined.
The source code in tutorials/https/confined/confined.c
defines symbols for all the constituents that the program receives.
One of these is a TCPPortNum capability for the port that you specified
in main/test.h.
This sample program listens on that port and echoes lines it reads.
You can demonstrate this by connecting to that port of the CapROS System
using telnet.
