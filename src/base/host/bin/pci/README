This is a set of tools to facilitate updating the master list of PCI
devices.  It is not part of the normal build, because the output it
generates ends up in the kernel and in various other libraries.  The
purpose of this utility is to let me easily cross-check the EROS list
against the list maintained by Jim Boemler and against the LINUX
source code.
