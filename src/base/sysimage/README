The 'volmap' file here is a reasonable sample for a new, ramdisk-based
system.  Ultimately, it is intended that the image built in this
directory should be ramdisk based.  It should include a migrator, a
disk formatter, and a minimal input system, but NOT a floppy driver in
the kernel.  

The ramdisk-based system should determine and format the appropriate
user partition, create a set of new ranges on the newly formatted disk
that match the ranges in the ramdisk **including the checkpoint
range**, mount them, and cause two checkpoints.  The two checkpoints
will guarantee that the mirroring has completed.  It should then
request that the floppy be removed and reboot the system.

On restart, execution will simply continue from the post-install code
as recovered from the checkpointed system image that is now resident
on the hard disk.
