This test demos the creation of a "subsession" and subsequent
rendering by an external domain.  The green window represents the
"parent" client that wishes to reserve a subset of its real estate for
rendering by another domain.  To do that, the green client creates an
invisible window as a bounding rectangle, fabricates a new session
creator with the invisible window as its container, and hands that new
session creator to an external domain.  That new domain creates a new
session and a new window within that session and renders some pixel
designs in that window.  The important thing to note in this test is
that the invisible window is much smaller than the window the external
domain creates.  This makes the "subsession" window appear to be
irregularly clipped, but I wanted to clearly demonstrate the logic for
subsession windows.  Note that the domain which renders the pixel
designs has no knowledge of the invisible window.  Also, the "green
client" domain has no knowledge of the window into which pixel designs
are rendered.  

In real life, the pixel design client would query the
window system as to the dimensions of its session's container and thus
cooperate with those dimensions.
