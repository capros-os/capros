This is a demo of the copy/paste functionality of the window system.
Two windows are created, one as the "copier" and one as the "paster".
The domain that owns the "copier" window has some static text that is
placed in the copy buffer whenever the user enters CTRL-C when the
"copier" window has focus.  The domain that owns the "paster" window
receives a capability to read that static text whenever CTRL-V is
subsequently entered when its window has focus.  Note: as of this
writing, there is a difference between a client window's decoration
having focus and the client window itself having focus.  Thus, make
sure you left click inside the client parts of the windows to set the
appropriate focus!


(Both domains (the "copier" and the "paster") use an ETerm domain to
provide a graphical window into which text can easily be rendered.)
