This domain demonstrates the use of the rudimentary graphics library
currently available.  The EROS graphics library (eros_gl) is based on
OpenGL and purely serves as a model for how a real graphics library
might be written for EROS.  This test renders different pixel patterns
in one graphical window.  Between the rendering of each pixel pattern,
the domain waits for the user to press a key before continuing.
