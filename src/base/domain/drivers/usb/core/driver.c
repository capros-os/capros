/**
 * usb_match_id - find first usb_device_id matching device or interface
 * @interface: the interface of interest
 * @id: array of usb_device_id structures, terminated by zero entry
 *
 * usb_match_id searches an array of usb_device_id's and returns
 * the first one matching the device or interface, or null.
 * This is used when binding (or rebinding) a driver to an interface.
 * Most USB device drivers will use this indirectly, through the usb core,
 * but some layered driver frameworks use it directly.
 * These device tables are exported with MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE, through
 * modutils, to support the driver loading functionality of USB hotplugging.
 *
 * What Matches:
 *
 * The "match_flags" element in a usb_device_id controls which
 * members are used.  If the corresponding bit is set, the
 * value in the device_id must match its corresponding member
 * in the device or interface descriptor, or else the device_id
 * does not match.
 *
 * "driver_info" is normally used only by device drivers,
 * but you can create a wildcard "matches anything" usb_device_id
 * as a driver's "modules.usbmap" entry if you provide an id with
 * only a nonzero "driver_info" field.  If you do this, the USB device
 * driver's probe() routine should use additional intelligence to
 * decide whether to bind to the specified interface.
 *
 * What Makes Good usb_device_id Tables:
 *
 * The match algorithm is very simple, so that intelligence in
 * driver selection must come from smart driver id records.
 * Unless you have good reasons to use another selection policy,
 * provide match elements only in related groups, and order match
 * specifiers from specific to general.  Use the macros provided
 * for that purpose if you can.
 *
 * The most specific match specifiers use device descriptor
 * data.  These are commonly used with product-specific matches;
 * the USB_DEVICE macro lets you provide vendor and product IDs,
 * and you can also match against ranges of product revisions.
 * These are widely used for devices with application or vendor
 * specific bDeviceClass values.
 *
 * Matches based on device class/subclass/protocol specifications
 * are slightly more general; use the USB_DEVICE_INFO macro, or
 * its siblings.  These are used with single-function devices
 * where bDeviceClass doesn't specify that each interface has
 * its own class.
 *
 * Matches based on interface class/subclass/protocol are the
 * most general; they let drivers bind to any interface on a
 * multiple-function device.  Use the USB_INTERFACE_INFO
 * macro, or its siblings, to match class-per-interface style
 * devices (as recorded in bInterfaceClass).
 *
 * Note that an entry created by USB_INTERFACE_INFO won't match
 * any interface if the device class is set to Vendor-Specific.
 * This is deliberate; according to the USB spec the meanings of
 * the interface class/subclass/protocol for these devices are also
 * vendor-specific, and hence matching against a standard product
 * class wouldn't work anyway.  If you really want to use an
 * interface-based match for such a device, create a match record
 * that also specifies the vendor ID.  (Unforunately there isn't a
 * standard macro for creating records like this.)
 *
 * Within those groups, remember that not all combinations are
 * meaningful.  For example, don't give a product version range
 * without vendor and product IDs; or specify a protocol without
 * its associated class and subclass.

 * usb_autopm_put_interface - decrement a USB interface's PM-usage counter

 * finished using @intf and wants to allow it to autosuspend.  A typical
 * example would be a character-device driver when its device file is
 * closed.
 *
 * The routine decrements @intf's usage counter.  When the counter reaches
 * 0, a delayed autosuspend request for @intf's device is queued.  When
 * the delay expires, if @intf->pm_usage_cnt is still <= 0 along with all
 * the other usage counters for the sibling interfaces and @intf's
 * usb_device, the device and all its interfaces will be autosuspended.
 *
 * Note that @intf->pm_usage_cnt is owned by the interface driver.  The
 * core will not change its value other than the increment and decrement
 * in usb_autopm_get_interface and usb_autopm_put_interface.  The driver
 * may use this simple counter-oriented discipline or may set the value
 * any way it likes.
 *
 * If the driver has set @intf->needs_remote_wakeup then autosuspend will
 * take place only if the device's remote-wakeup facility is enabled.
 *
 * Suspend method calls queued by this routine can arrive at any time
 * while @intf is resumed and its usage counter is equal to 0.  They are
 * not protected by the usb_device's lock but only by its pm_mutex.
 * Drivers must provide their own synchronization.
