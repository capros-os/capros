Building http

There are two ways of building the http server, one as a CapROS process,
and one as a Unix "main" program for self test. If the SELF_TEST switch
is included in the compile command, it will build in self test mode and
be runnable under unix (and gdb, recommended).

In addition, the SHORT_READ switch will limit network read lengths to 1,
which allows testing for packet boundry bugs. This switch is effective
in both self test and CapROS modes.

There is a shell script, ./testbuild, which will build the test mode
version when run in the domain/http directory. In its released form,
it has the SHORT_READ2 switch set, which does nothing, but is easy to
change to SHORT_READ should that be wanted.


The command:

curl -kT test https://localhost:5001/notafile?4321

Will upload the local file "test" to the CapROS https serve where it will
be stored in the directory as 4321.


The command:

curl -k -o local https://localhost:5001/notafile?1234

Will fetch the CapROS file 1234 and place it in "local".

Note that the -k switch disables curl's check of the server's certificate
against the available certificate authorities. A future investigation is
how to build a CA certificate authorizing the server certificate we build
and getting curl to use is.

Files may also be downloaded using a https uri in Firefox:

https://localhost:5001/fubar?1234

Will fetch the CapROS file 1234 and offer to store it locally under the
name fubar.
