/** Migrator tool.

Restart and migration are driven by a non-persistent process
called the migrator process.
One reason for this has to do with process control.
If, for example, the sequence stalls waiting for a resource
such as a page frame, the kernel will put this process on a StallQueue,
and wake it up when the resource is available.
This process can then restart the sequence using this capability.
Only the migrator process should hold this capability.
