/* 
 * Key.  A Key is a capability, in the sense of Hydra or the Sigma-7.
 * EROS is a pure capability system, which means that Keys are the
 * only namespace known to the system.  They are therefore the *only*
 * way that one can refer to an object within EROS.
 * 
 * A Key names a Page (see Page.hxx), a Node (see Node.hxx), a Number,
 * or one of the EROS devices or miscellaneous kernel tools.
 * 
 * Keys have an on-disk and in-core form.  Both are 3 words.  A valid
 * in-core key points to an in-core object.
 * 
 * Before being used, a Key must be converted to in-core form, but
 * this is done in a lazy fashion, so many of the Keys that happen to
 * be in core remain encoded in the on-disk form.  A Key that has been
 * converted for use in its in-core form is said to be "prepared."
 * 
 * Number, Device, and Miscellaneous keys have the same form on disk
 * as in core:
 * 
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |             Data[31:0]            |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |             Data[63:32]           |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |000 Type|    Data[87:64]           |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * 
 * NOTE: Reorder per machine's natural word order for long long
 * 
 * In the in-core form, the P bit is always set (1).  This eliminates
 * the need to special case the check for Key preparedness for this
 * class of Keys.
 * 
 * The Type field encodes only primary keys, and is always 5 bits
 * wide. In the Number key, the Data slots hold the numeric value.  In
 * Device and Miscellaneous key, they differentiate the called device
 * or tool.
 * 
 * The Sanity field is used by the system sanity checker to verify
 * that the world is sane.  It's value should not be examined or
 * counted on.
 * 
 * 
 * Page and Node keys (all other cases) are a bit different in core
 * then they are on disk:
 * 
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |          Allocation Count         |    PREPARED IN CORE
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |   Pointer to ObHeader for object  |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |Phh Type|Datauint8_t|    OID[47:32]   |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * 
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |          Allocation Count         |    ON DISK
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |             OID[31:0]             |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |000 Type|Datauint8_t|    OID[47:32]   |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * 
 * For an interpretation of the fields, see eros/KeyType.hxx.
 * 
 * The Datauint8_t is an 8 bit value handed to the recipient when the Key
 * is invoked.  It allows the recipient to handle multiple client
 * classes by providing each client class with a unique Datauint8_t.
 * 
 * The ObHeader Pointer is an in-core pointer to the object denoted by
 * the Key.
 * 
 * The Allocation Count is used to rescind keys to pages and notes.
 * This is described in the rescind logic for Keys.
