<title>The EROS Build Environment</title>
</head>

<body>
<p> This is a brief note on the organization of the EROS build
environment.  It describes the organization of the source tree, the
environment variables you need to set to get the code built, and in
general describes the rational behind the whole thing.  If you're just
getting started on examining or modifying the sources, this is
probably worth reading.
<p> I don't make any particular claims for the merits of this build
environment organization.  It works so far, and that's good enough for
our current purposes.
<h1>Brief Overview</h1>
<p> The EROS source tree will eventually include support for several
target architectures and several different build environments.  The
architecture for which we are compiling is known as the
<em>target</em> architecture.  The machine on which we are performing
the compile is known as the <em>host</em> architecture.  In the vast
majority of cases, these two architectures will be closely related.
The <code>i486</code> target architecture, for example, is most
commonly built from either the <code>i486-eros</code> or the
<code>i486-posix-aout</code> host environment.
<p> The current build tree probably would NOT succeed at building
across incompatible architectures from a UNIX host, nor do we intend
that it ever should.  Our intention is to bootstrap the i486 EROS
implementation from the linux environment, and do subsequent
development from the i486 EROS environment, where we have full control
over the compilation environment.  The tool naming conventions for
UNIX cross environments come in a bewildering number of varieties, and
I really do not want to use the GNU configure facilities, so it is
simpler to keep matters contained by building other EROS systems from
the i486 EROS environment.
<p> The source tree makes use of the host/target distinction.  Target
architecture specific files will <em>usually</em> reside in a
subdirectory whose name is something like
<strong>.../arch/</strong><em>target_architecture</em>
<strong>/...</strong>.  Similarly, host-specific files will always
reside in a subdirectory such as
<strong>.../host/</strong><em>host_architecture</em>
<strong>/...</strong>.  The EROS makefiles determine which
subdirectories are appropriate by examining the environment variables
<strong>EROS_HOST</strong> and <strong>EROS_TARGET</strong>.
<p> In general, files that are not in the target specific subtrees
should be independent of any particular target architecture, and do
not include any target-dependent header files.  There is an exception
to this rule: certain attributes of the target architecture, such as
the target page size, are used in the machine independent portion of
the code.  These attributes are captured in the file
<strong>sys/include/target.h</strong>, which contains these attributes
for all supported target architectures.
<p> Surprisingly enough, the presence of multiple architectures in the
source tree is not a major source of complexity.  For the most part,
things that are dependent on the target architecture do not interact
much with other target architectures.  Things that are dependent on
the host architecture are more complicated.  Typically, the host
architecture programs are cross tools, intended to take, say, a
collection of linux <strong>a.out</strong> files and produce a
runnable system image from them.  While the same tool runs fine under
the EROS POSIX environment, it is more common under EROS to want to
test a new domain ``in situ''.  Thus, building EROS from the native
environment builds more tools than from the cross environment.
<h1>A Tour of the Source Tree</h1>
The EROS source tree is divided into several major sections:
<pre>
eros
   src
      bin           -- volume manipulation tools, misc binaries
      doc           -- documentation files, including this one
      domains       -- source code for critical system domains
      lib           -- common "library" files
      posix         -- source code for the POSIX subsystem
      sys           -- operating system related code:
         sys        -- include files common to all OS and volume code
         libkern    -- classes related to disk volumes that are used
                       by both the kernel and the volume tools
         kernel     -- kernel source code
   domains          -- where compiled domains are installed
   posix            -- where the posix environment gets installed
   bin              -- where the volume tools get installed
   lib              -- where various miscellaneous pieces get installed
</pre>
When building under a POSIX environment, the tree can be placed
anywhere convenient.  The environment variable
<strong>BUILDROOT</strong> identifies the location of the root of the
tree. My own practice is to place the root of the tree in my home
directory, and set <strong>BUILDROOT</strong> to
<strong>/home/shap/eros</strong>.  There are no explicit paths in the
makefiles.  Whenever dependencies are regenerated a <em>sed</em>
script is used to convert absolute paths back to references to the
<strong>BUILDROOT</strong> variable.
<p> From the standpoint of a developer, the tree can be divided into
several cleanly separated parts. The following discussoin describes
each of these parts in turn.
<h2>The Kernel Source Tree</h2> 
<p> the kernel source tree is rooted at
<strong>$BUILDROOT/src/sys</strong>:
<pre>
eros/src/sys
   arch         -- architecture specific code
      ppc603    -- code specific to the PowerPC (someday)
      i486      -- code specific to the Intel family (i[34]86, Pentium, P6)
         boot   -- disk bootstrap code
         kernel -- kernel code
   disk         -- disk volume object manipulation library, used by the
                   kernel and a few utilities.  See the notes on this
                   directory below.
   kernel       -- the eros kernel common (machine independent) code
   sys          -- public header files contributed by the kernel to the
                   general include tree.
</pre>
<p> The convention for kernel code is that no file which is part of
the kernel should make reference to any file that is outside of the
<strong>sys/</strong> subtree.  The idea is that the kernel should not
depend on application code.
<p> The <strong>disk/</strong> subtree is unusual in that it's content
must be built for both kernel and non-kernel use.  The kernel uses
these files to manipulate the on-disk key structures.  The initial
system generation tools use these files to construct EROS volume
images out of collections of <strong>a.out</strong> files.  All of the
code in this directory must be compilable in the kernel, which means
in particular that it must make no use of stdio facilities.  This in
turn implies that the disk volume manipulation code issues no
diagnostics.
