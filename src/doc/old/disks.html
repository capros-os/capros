<TITLE>The EROS Disk Structure</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
While EROS can provide reliability improvement and fault containment
in diskless environments, the system is designed for persistence.  As
a result, the disk subsystem(s) enjoy a special relationship with the
EROS kernel.  This document describes how EROS manages the disk
subsystem, including the treatment of foreign partitions.
<H1>1. Disk Paritions and EROS Volumes</H1>
<P>
Many (perhaps most) machines provide a mechanism for partitioning
physical disks into multiple logical disks.  The best known (and most
poorly thought out) example is probably the disk partition mechanism
imposed on the PC world by IBM.  Parititions are used in a different
sense in most UNIX systems.  Some logical volume management subsystems
can also be thought of as partitions.
<P>
In both the DOS world and the minicomputer world, partitions are
commonly used to allow multiple operating systems to coexist on a
single piece of hardware.  This means that EROS must somehow address
the issue of partitioning.  Until recently, this could have been done
simply by ignoring non-EROS partitions, but the recent increase in
popularity of emulation environments for DOS, Windows, UNIX,
etc. etc. means that EROS must now be prepared to deal with foreign
partitions somehow.
<P>
EROS reduces the problem of partitioning to management of nondivisible
<STRONG>volumes</STRONG>, and then performs it's own handling of space
allocation within native EROS volumes.  If the underlying media is
partitioned, each partition corresponds to a single volume.  When a
disk is first mounted by the system, the partitions are identified
using logic that is architecture specific.  Each partition, whether it
is an EROS partition or not, is mounted as a volume.  If the media
does not provide for partitions (e.g. floppy disks on the PC), the
entire disk is mounted as a single volume.
<P>
As it is mounted, the kernel examines each volume to determine if it
is an EROS volume.  Volumes whose content is known to EROS are mounted
as <STRONG>native volumes</STRONG>. All other volumes are mounted as
<STRONG>foreign volumes</STRONG>.  EROS provides a low-level
read/write interface to foreign volumes, but does not provide
persistence guarantees or bad sector handling for such volumes.
<P>
EROS does not make a distinction between installations at the volume
level.  This is a significant departure from the customary way of
using partitions.  If multiple EROS systems are installed, all EROS
volumes will be mounted by every EROS system, regardless of which
system they originated from.  Distinctions between systems are
maintained at a subvolume level.
<P>
There are several reasons for this departure from customary practice:
<UL>
<LI> 
The EROS mechanism for allocating space within volumes is more
flexible than partitioning, and I'm sick and tired of repartitioning
my machines all the time.
<P>
<LI> 
Using a subvolume system id allows multiple EROS installations to be
run simulaneously by the same kernel, which can be helpful in
debugging or in transitioning to new releases.
<P>
<LI> 
It happened this way because I didn't think it through at first, and
in this case the results were fortuitous, so I left them as they stood.
<P>
</UL>
<H1>2. Structure of an EROS Volume</H1>
<P>
Given the preceding discussion, it should be clear that an EROS volume
is a logical disk.  Every EROS volume is into multiple non-overlapping
areas called <STRONG>divisions</STRONG>. Divisions come in several
types:
<PRE>
Unused      Empty. Placeholder for unallocated space.
Boot*       Contains the system-dependent boot code.
DivTbl*     A table describing the division layout.
Kernel      The kernel's code.
Spare       Division containing spare sectors.
Swap        A swap area.
Page        Holds EROS Pages.
Node        Holds EROS Nodes.
FailStart   Names the process to start if all else fails.
</PRE>
<P>
There are several requirements for a correctly formatted EROS volume:
<UL>
<LI> 
Every
volume has <EM>exactly one</EM> boot division beginning at sector 0.
<P>
<LI> 
Every volume has a primary division table, which may appear at any
location.
<P>
<LI> 
A volume can have an <EM>optional</EM> secondary division table, which
may appear at any location.
<P>
<LI> 
Every volume has <EM>at most one</EM> kernel division, which may
appear at any location.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Every volume therefore has a boot division and a division table.  In
principle, all other divisions are optional, though a useful volume
will have at least one other division type.
<P>
The FailStart entry does not name a division on the disk.  Rather, it
is a pseudo-entry used to bootstrap the system.  It's use is described
in detail below.
<P>
<H2>2.1. The Boot Sector</H2>
<P>
Every disk technology that we know about reserves sector 0 of a
partition the "boot sector." EROS reserves a boot sector in every
volume. Once booted, the boot sector is referenced to find the
locations from which the primary (and optional secondary) division
table is read.  On volumes that are actually bootable, the boot
division contains the bootstrap code.  On most machines, the bootstrap
code has proven to be small, and we simply write it to all volumes.
<H2>2.2. The Division Table</H2>
<P>
For each division, the division table describes the type, the starting
sector, the ending sector, and a unique system identifier.  If the
division is a Node, Page, or Swap division, the division table also
contains the starting CDA or SwapLoc of the division.
<H2>2.3. The Spare Division</H2>
<P>
The Spare division is used to hold replacement sectors for defective
media.  The mapping from old (bad) sectors to sectors in the spare
area lives in the division table(s) following the division list.
As an EROS volume is formatted, a list of bad sectors is accumulated
by the formatting program.  Bad sectors that are found in Page, Node,
or Swap divisions are added to the BadMap.  Bad sectors that are found
in other types of divisions cause formatting to fail.  Usually these
failures can be worked around by rearranging the volume map to avoid
the bad sectors.
<P>
Many disk types (SCSI, most IDE) provide automatic sector remapping.
On these devices, the spare division is omitted, and EROS leaves bad
sector management to the underlying device.
<H1>3. The Boot Process</H1>
<P>
When the machine is powered up or reset, the firmware determines which
volume (disk or partition) will be booted.  Though the details are
machine specific, the firmware typically proceeds by loading a small
machine-dependent boot sector from sector 0 of the boot volume.
Usually, the boot sector must first load a larger bootstrap routine,
which in turn examines the volume map and loads the kernel itself.
At this point, the EROS kernel proceeds with it's own startup
procedure.
<P>
At a high level, the EROS kernel startup proceeds as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Perform the minimum required hardware initialization.
<LI>
Determine the unique system identifier (USID) of the running kernel.
<LI>
Locate and mount all divisions on all disks whose USID matches the
USID of the running kernel.
<LI> 
Locate the run list and begin executing the running processes.  The
run list can come from one of two locations:
<UL>
<LI> 
If a swap areas has been located, the list of running processes is
obtained from the most recent valid checkpoint image in the swap area.
<LI> 
If no swap area exists, the FailStart entries in the boot volume's
division table constitute the running process list.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
The net effect of this is that EROS will restart the existing system
image if possible.  If no existing system image can be found, it will
load a minimal system starting set.  The intention is that this
minimal process set will be sufficient to enable system recovery.
<P>
There are two security-related assumptions embedded in this bootstrap
mechanism:
<UL>
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the boot media,
the system is not secure.
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the system
console, and the swap area(s) have been damaged or do not exist, the
system is not secure.
</UL>
<P>
The intent of the FailStart mechanism is to simplify initial
installation of the system.  It eliminates the need to construct a
swap area on the installation floppy.  Being able to run the kernel
before the swapping logic has been debugged greatly simplifies initial
testing.
<P>
Some other potential uses of the FailStart mechanism include:
<UL>
<LI> 
Degrading gracefully when a swap device cannot be found because it is
offline.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Recovering from sector 0 failures on non-boot volumes.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Implementing system startup in embedded systems that boot from a ROM
and do not have a swap area at all.
</UL>
<P>
The FailStart mechanism was not present in the KeyKOS system.  It's
uses and abuses have not been fully explored.
<H2>3.1. Finding the Unique System Identifier</H2>
<P>
When the EROS kernel starts up, it performs some minimal hardware
initialization and then locates the boot volume.  It loads the boot
sector to learn the location of the division table on the boot volume,
and then loads the division table itself.  From the kernel entry in
the division table, it learns the system id of the kernel that was
booted.
<P>
<I>An alternative would be to have the system ID passed to the kernel
by the bootstrap routine, which has the information available in any
case.</I>
<H2>3.2. Mounting the Divisions</H2>
<P>
Having determined the unique system identifier, the kernel now loads
the master partition table of every disk, and searches for EROS
volumes.  For every EROS volume that it finds, it loads the division
table.  For every Page, Node, and Swap division whose USID matches
that of the running system, the division is mounted and the pages and
nodes in that division are made available to the object loading
subsystem.
<H2>3.3. Finding the Run List</H2>
<P>
Once all of the divisions are known, the kernel must locate the list
of processes to run.  If a swap area is available, the run list is
loaded from the swap area.  If no swap area is available, then the
FailStart entries from the boot volume's division table are used.  The
processes named in the run list are swapped in and scheduled.
<P>
Once these processes have been started, the system is running
normally, and bootstrap processing terminates.
