<TITLE>EROS Context Switch on the i386 family</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>1. Background</H1>
The EROS context switch path is carefully tuned, and tries to get the
best leverage possible out of the processor.  In the case of the i386,
i486, and Pentium processors, the mechanism of kernel entry is
regrettably complex.  Here are some reasons for the
complexity:
<UL>
<LI> 
There is an absurdly complex set of options for how tasks can be
running.  EROS reduces this by fiat: we don't support a protected
segmented code model.  Still, the presence of virtual 8086 mode does
introduce some curious cases that need to be handled in the interrupt
path.
<LI>
Not all interrupts leave the same information on the stack.  Some push
an error code, others do not.  It is necessary to correct for this on
the interrupt entry path to simplify later error handling.
<LI>
If a user-level process <EM>desires</EM> to enter the kernel (e.g. is
performing a call, fork, or return operation), using a call gate is
faster than executing an <CODE>int</CODE> instruction.  Unfortunately,
the call gate does not create the same stack image as the
<CODE>int</CODE> instruction.
<LI> 
The timing of certain instructions changes the preferred encoding of
the context switch path.  On the i486 and earlier processors,
the<CODE>pushad</CODE> instruction is slow; register save is better
implemented by hand.  On the Pentium, using the <CODE>pusha</CODE>
instruction is allegedly faster, though the effect of instruction
pairing needs to be examined to be sure.
</UL>
<P>
There is some humor to be had in the insanity of the kernel entry
situation.  It's actually pretty easy to <EM>exit</EM> the kernel
through a common path.  While the design of the call gate mechanism is
clearly oriented towards use of the <CODE>ret</CODE> instruction, it
is possible to abuse the <CODE>iret</CODE> instruction to handle the
problem.
<H1>2. Possible Running Modes</H1>
An EROS process can be running in one of two modes:
<UL>
<LI>
A flat, 32-bit, unsegmented address space.
<LI>
So-called <STRONG>virtual 8086</STRONG> mode, in which segment
registers do not refer to the global descriptor tables.
</UL>
<P>
EROS does not currently support any protected-mode segmented execution
model.  The basic rationale for this is that by the time we get around
to that people will have given up running such code and moved to the
Win32 model.
<P>
<H2>2.1 Entering the Kernel from 32-bit Code</H2>
There are two mechanisms for entering the kernel from 32-bit code:
call gates and interrupts.  Since the common return logic uses the
<CODE>iret</CODE> instruction, the stack created by the interrupt
logic is defined to be the natural stack layout.
<H3>2.1.1 Interrupts From 32-bit Mode</H3>
<P>
When an interrupt occurs in a 32-bit mode process, several register
values are pushed onto the stack.  Depending on the interrupt taken,
an error code may or may not pushed.  Whether the error code is pushed
depends on which interrupt is taken and whether the interrupt
originated in hardware or software.
<P>
The EROS interrupt dispatch configuration is designed to ensure that
the stack layout is normalized.   Generally, software interrupts are
precluded by the descriptor privilege level mechanism.  The entry
points for hardware interrupts that do not push an error code correct
this by explicitly pushing a 0 error code onto the stack.
<P>
The resulting stack looks like:
<PRE>
error code
user EIP     <- top of stack
user CS
EFLAGS
user ESP
user SS
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>2.1.1 Call Gates From 32-bit Mode</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>int</CODE> instruction is not the fastest way into the
kernel by a substantial margin.  A call gate instruction is nearly 30
cycles faster.  As a result, the EROS <STRONG>call</STRONG>,
<STRONG>fork</STRONG>, and <STRONG>return</STRONG> operations are
implemented on top of the call gate mechanism.  
<P>
Unfortunately, the call gate mechanism does not create the same stack
image as the interupt mechanism.  After a call gate has been
performed, the stack looks like:
<PRE>
user EIP     <- top of stack
user CS
user ESP
user SS
</PRE>
<P>
Note that EFLAGS is missing, and there is of course no error code.
<P>
If there is an elegant way to solve this, we haven't found it.
Instead, the call path bumps the stack pointer, pushes a zero error
code, and saves the processor registers:
<PRE>
fault address (0)
EDI
ESI
EBP
EBX
EDX
ECX
EAX
error code (0)
hole
user EIP
user CS
user ESP
user SS
</PRE>
<P>
Having created some working space, it then reaches back and rearranges
things, forging an appropriate value for EFLAGS.  
<P>
The final stack image, which is the same as the image created by the
interrupt entry points, looks like:
<PRE>
fault address (0)
EDI
ESI
EBP
EBX
EDX
ECX
EAX
error code (0)
user EIP
user CS
EFLAGS (forged)
user ESP
user SS
</PRE>
<P>
Rather than save these values and then copy them into the process
table, the kernel connives things so that the supervisor stack pointer
always points directly into the process save area.  It's ugly, but
effective.

<H2>2.2 Entering the Kernel from Virtual 8086 Mode</H2>

Virtual 8086 mode processes are unable to invoke call gates, so the
principle IPC path does not need to be concerned with them.
