<TITLE>Generating a Bootable EROS System</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
This document describes the programs used to generate a bootable EROS
floppy disk.  It provides a brief description of the cross environment
system generation tools.  Mostly, it focuses on the syntax of the EROS
sysgen file, which is used to write onto the floppy those domains that
are needed during the "big bang".
<H1>1. Introduction</H1>
<P>
EROS is usually cross developed from a substantial programming
environment.  The original implementation of EROS (for the x86) was
coded under LINUX.  Subsequent editions will hopefully be produced in
an EROS-hosted environment, but the generated floppy image is always
viewed by the running EROS as a "raw" floppy.  There are two reasons
for this:
<UL>
<LI> 
Domains placed on the initial boot volume run under some very unusual
constraints, and generally need to be hand constructed.
<LI> 
The generated system is generally a different EROS version, either for
a foreign architecture or for a different version of the same
architecture, so the native tools (e.g. domain creator) are probably
not suitable for creating the components on the generated system.
</UL>
<P>
Creating a bootable system image entails the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>
Creating, using a set of cross compilation tools, an EROS kernel image
and boot sector(s) for the target architecture.
<LI>
Creating, using a set of cross compilation tools, the domains required
during the initial system load (ISL).
<LI> 
Formatting a volume to include a boot sector, a kernel image and
suitably prepared EROS divisions, including performing any necessary
bad sector detection and remapping (<STRONG>mkvol</STRONG>).
<LI>
Writing the ISL domains onto the volume (<STRONG>sysgen</STRONG>).
</OL>
<P>
This document describes the EROS volume structure and boot process,
and the use of the sysgen tool.
<H1>2. Structure of an EROS Volume</H1>
<P>
An EROS volume is a logical disk.  On an EROS-formatted floppy, the
volume spans the entire disk.  On hard disks things are a bit more
complicated.   Typically, the system firmware is designed to allow
multiple independent operating systems to be loaded onto a single
disk.  The disk is divided into non-overlapping regions, typically
called <STRONG>partitions</STRONG>, and each operating system acts for
the most part as it's partition was a single disk.  EROS is no
different; it views it's partition as a single volume, and largely
ignores the rest of the disk.
<P>
Every EROS volume has up to 64 non-overlapping areas.  To avoid
collision with firmware terminology, we use the term
<STRONG>division</STRONG>.  Divisions come in several types:
<PRE>
Unused      Empty. Placeholder for unallocated space.
Boot        Contains the system-dependent boot code.
DivTbl      A table describing the division layout.
Kernel      The kernel's code.
Spare       Division containing spare sectors.
Swap        A swap area.
Page        Holds EROS Pages.
Node        Holds EROS Nodes.
FailStart   Names the process to start if all else fails.
</PRE>
<P>
The FailStart entry does not name a division on the disk.  Rather, it
is a pseudo-entry used to bootstrap the system.  It's use is described
in detail below.  Every volume has exactly one boot division at sector
0.  Every volume has <EM>at most one</EM> kernel division.
<P>
Every disk technology that we know about reserves sector 0 of a
partition the "boot sector."  The EROS boot sector has reserved
locations from which the locations of the primary (and optional
secondary) division tables can be read.
<P>
For each division, the division table describes the type, the starting
sector, the ending sector, and a unique system identifier.  If the
division is a Node, Page, or Swap division, the division table also
contains the starting CDA or SwapLoc of the division.
<H1>2.1 Formatting and Spare Sectors</H1> 
<P>
Volume formatting is performed by the <STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> utility.
The <STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> program formats a raw volume for use as an
EROS volume.  It takes as input a volume map file that describes how
the disk should be formatted and the name of the volume file (on UNIX,
the <EM>raw</EM> file corresponding to the EROS parition), and an
optional disk descriptor type.  Currently valid descriptor types are
<STRONG>fd144</STRONG> and <STRONG>fd</STRONG>.  Descriptor types are
used to describe the desired layout of the target volume when not
writing directly to the raw device.
<P>
In order for a volume to be usable, the <STRONG>kernel</STRONG>,
<STRONG>boot</STRONG>, and <STRONG>divtbl</STRONG> divisions must be
error free.  (We know how to remove this restriction for the kernel
division, but have not done the necessary work in the boot loader to
support sector remapping).
<P>
Some disk subsystems (SCSI, some IDE) provide automatic sector
remapping.  On these subsystems, no <STRONG>spare</STRONG> division is
required, and the EROS kernel relies on the underlying hardware to
provide remapping services.  On disk subsystems that require OS-implemented
remapping, the <STRONG>spare</STRONG> division will be used, if
present, as a pool of spare sectors.  <EM>The spare division is always
optional.</EM>  If it is not present, no remapping will be performed.
The system generation process, for example, does not place a
<STRONG>spare</STRONG> division on the ISL floppies, because we assume
that the distribution media will be free of errors.
<P>
If a <STRONG>spare</STRONG> division is present, the bad sector
remapping information is kept in the same disk page as the division
table, and directly follows the division table entries.  This allows a
disk to have up to 384 bad sectors.  Beyond that number, we think it's
probably time to replace the disk.
<P>
As an EROS volume is formatted, a list of bad sectors is accumulated
by the formatting program.  Bad sectors that are found in Page, Node,
or Swap divisions are added to the BadMap.  Bad sectors that are found
in other types of divisions cause formatting to fail.  Usually these
failures can be worked around by rearranging the volume map to avoid
the bad sectors.
<H2>2.2 The mkvol Volume Map</H2>
<P>
The <STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> utility performs formatting according to a
volume map.  The volume map is essentially a human-readable version of
the division table to be created.  It describes the start and end of
each division, and for some divisions it provides the file that should
be used to initialize that division (for example: the file containing
the code for the boot sector).
<P>
The <CODE>volmap</CODE> file syntax is very simple.  Comments are
preceded by the '<KBD>#</KBD>' character.  Valid statements in the
volmap file are:
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>kernel</STRONG> [<EM>size</EM>] [ <EM>kernel file</EM> ]
</STRONG>
<DD>
Describes the kernel division.  The size, if provided, indicates the
number of pages that should be reserved for the kernel.  The kernel
file, if provided, will be written into the kernel division after the
a.out file header is stripped off.  If no kernel image name is
provided, /eros/lib/boot/eros.image will be used.  If no size is
provided, the smallest division that will hold the kernel image will
be created.
<P>
At most one kernel division can be present per volume.
<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>divtbl</STRONG>
<DD>
Indicates that a division table should be written at this point on the
disk.  Up to two <STRONG>divtbl</STRONG> statements can appear in the
volmap file.  The first will be used as the primary division table
location.  The second will be used as the alternate division table
location.
<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>spare</STRONG> [<EM>secs</EM>]
<DD>
Indicates that a division of <EM>secs</EM> sectors (rounded up to the
nearest page) should be reserved.  There can be only one spare
division per volume.  If a volume contains a spare division, the EROS
kernel will perform bad sector handling for that volume.
<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>page</STRONG> <EM>count</EM> <STRONG>CDA=</STRONG><EM>cda</EM>
<DD>
Indicates that a page division containing <EM>count</EM> EROS pages
should be created.  The <STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> utility automatically
computes the number of sectors required to hold the pages and the
associated page pots.  All pages are created with an initial
allocation count of 0.
All data space in the page division is
initialized to zero.
<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>node</STRONG> <EM>count</EM> <STRONG>CDA=</STRONG><EM>cda</EM>
<DD>
Indicates that a node division containing <EM>count</EM> EROS nodes
should be created.  The <STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> utility automatically
computes the number of sectors required to hold the pages and the
associated page pots.  All nodes are created with an initial
allocation count and call count of 0.  All keys in the node division
are initialized to zero number keys.
<P>
<DT>
<STRONG>swap</STRONG> <EM>count</EM>
<DD>
Indicates that a swap division countaining <EM>count</EM> pages
should be created.  EROS uses a ring buffer approach to managing swap
areas.  It is not necessary to specify what generation the swap area
belongs to.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
Note that <STRONG>FailStart</STRONG> entries are not accepted by the
<STRONG>mkvol</STRONG> utility.  These entries are added by the
<STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> program, which is described below.
<H1>3. The Sysgen Utility</H1>
<P>
By far the most complex part of generating a bootable EROS system is
placing the necessary domains onto the boot image.  This is done using
the <STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> utility.  Given a set of program
executables that are to be run as domains on the target systems, and a
descriptor file describing the interrelationships between these
programs, <STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> produces a set of nodes and pages
with appropriate keys, and adds any necessary
<STRONG>FailStart</STRONG>entries to the division table to make sure
that the appropriate startup programs are run.
<P>
The interprocess relationships during the initial system load process
are distressingly complex.  The <STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> tool reflects
this.  If you come up with a simpler mechanism, or even a way to
simplify the syntax of the descriptor file, <EM>please</EM> let us
know about it!
<H2>3.1. Crafting Domains</H2>
<P>
In the LINUX cross environment, domains are created as
<CODE>a.out</CODE> files.  These files are read by the
<STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> utility, which constructs segments and domains
from them.
<P>
The <STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> program has been designed for simplicity
rather than for flexibility.  Given an <CODE>a.out</CODE> file, it is
smart enough to create a suitable EROS segment.  The resulting segment
will have no keeper unless one is explicitly specified for it.  The
<STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> program will not automatically create segments
that require any unusual keys, nor does it know how to combine
segments (though the latter ability should probably be added).
<H2>3.2. The Volmap File</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>volmap</CODE> file specifies the components that should be
added to the EROS volume.  Each statement creates a domain, or
modifies the state of an existing domain or segment.  As with the
<CODE>volmap</CODE> file, comments are preceded by the '<KBD>#</KBD>'
character.  Valid statements in the sysmap file are:
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>domain</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> <EM>file</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Indicates that a domain should be created from <EM>file</EM>, which is
a UNIX a.out file.  An appropriate segment is created from the file,
and a domain is allocated.  Subsequent statements in the sysmap file
regarding this domain will use <EM>name</EM> to identify it.  Names
assigned in the sysmap file must be unique.
<P>
By default, a domain is created with a schedule key that grants it the
default execution priority.  Unless one is specified, neither the
domain nor its associated segment is given a keeper.
<P>
<DT>
<EM>name</EM> <STRONG>priority</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
<DD>
Replaces the schedule key in the named domain with a key conveying the
priority indicated by <EM>value</EM>.  Valid priorities are in the
range 1 to 16, with 8 being the default priority.
<P>
<DT>
<EM>name</EM> <STRONG>keeper</STRONG> <EM>keeper_domain</EM>
<DD>
Replaces the keeper slot of the named domain with a start key to
<EM>keeper_domain</EM>.
<P>
<DT>
<EM>name</EM> <STRONG>segkeeper</STRONG> <EM>keeper_domain</EM>
<DD>
Makes <EM>keeper_domain</EM> the segment keeper for the address space
segment of the named domain.  If the current address space segment is
a <STRONG>black segment</STRONG> it is first converted to a
<STRONG>red segment</STRONG>, if necessary by allocating a new node.
A start key to <EM>keeper_domain</EM> is placed in the keeper slot of
the resulting red segment node.
<P>
<DT>
<EM>name</EM> <STRONG>key</STRONG> <EM>slot</EM> <STRONG>=</STRONG>
<EM>key_description</EM>
<DD>
Replaces the indicated general key slot of the named domain with a key
created from the indicated <EM>key_description</EM>.  Key descriptions
are described in detail below.
<P>
<DT>
<EM>name</EM> <STRONG>failstart</STRONG>
<DD>
Adds a failstart entry for the named domain to volume's division table.
<P>
</DL>
The <STRONG>sysgen</STRONG> utility does not accept forward
references.  No references can be made to a domain or segment until
that domain has been defined.  Statements in the <CODE>sysmap</CODE>
file are processed sequentially.  If the effects of a statement
override the effects of a previous statement, no warning is given, and
no space allocated by the previous statement will be reclaimed.
<H1>4. The Boot Process</H1>
<P>
When the machine is powered up or reset, the firmware determines which
volume (disk or partition) will be booted.  Though the details are
machine specific, the firmware typically proceeds by loading a small
machine-dependent boot sector from sector 0 of the boot volume.
Usually, the boot sector must first load a larger bootstrap routine,
which in turn examines the volume map and loads the kernel itself.
At this point, the EROS kernel proceeds with it's own startup
procedure.
<P>
At a high level, the EROS kernel startup proceeds as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Perform the minimum required hardware initialization.
<LI>
Determine the unique system identifier (USID) of the running kernel.
<LI>
Locate and mount all divisions on all disks whose USID matches the
USID of the running kernel.
<LI> 
Locate the run list and begin executing the running processes.  The
run list can come from one of two locations:
<UL>
<LI> 
If a swap areas has been located, the list of running processes is
obtained from the most recent valid checkpoint image in the swap area.
<LI> 
If no swap area exists, the FailStart entries in the boot volume's
division table constitute the running process list.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
The net effect of this is that EROS will restart the existing system
image if possible.  If no existing system image can be found, it will
load a minimal system starting set.  The intention is that this
minimal process set will be sufficient to enable system recovery.
<P>
There are two security-related assumptions embedded in this bootstrap
mechanism:
<UL>
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the boot media,
the system is not secure.
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the system
console, and the swap area(s) have been damaged or do not exist, the
system is not secure.
</UL>
<P>
The intent of the FailStart mechanism is to simplify initial
installation of the system.  It eliminates the need to construct a
swap area on the installation floppy.  Being able to run the kernel
before the swapping logic has been debugged greatly simplifies initial
testing.
<P>
Some other potential uses of the FailStart mechanism include:
<UL>
<LI> 
Degrading gracefully when a swap device cannot be found because it is
offline.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Recovering from sector 0 failures on non-boot volumes.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Implementing system startup in embedded systems that boot from a ROM
and do not have a swap area at all.
</UL>
<P>
The FailStart mechanism was not present in the KeyKOS system.  It's
uses and abuses have not been fully explored.
<H2>3.1. Finding the Unique System Identifier</H2>
<P>
When the EROS kernel starts up, it performs some minimal hardware
initialization and then locates the boot volume.  It loads the boot
sector to learn the location of the division table on the boot volume,
and then loads the division table itself.  From the kernel entry in
the division table, it learns the system id of the kernel that was
booted.
<P>
<I>An alternative would be to have the system ID passed to the kernel
by the bootstrap routine, which has the information available in any
case.</I>
<H2>3.2. Mounting the Divisions</H2>
<P>
Having determined the unique system identifier, the kernel now loads
the master partition table of every disk, and searches for EROS
volumes.  For every EROS volume that it finds, it loads the division
table.  For every Page, Node, and Swap division whose USID matches
that of the running system, the division is mounted and the pages and
nodes in that division are made available to the object loading
subsystem.
<H2>3.3. Finding the Run List</H2>
<P>
Once all of the divisions are known, the kernel must locate the list
of processes to run.  If a swap area is available, the run list is
loaded from the swap area.  If no swap area is available, then the
FailStart entries from the boot volume's division table are used.  The
processes named in the run list are swapped in and scheduled.
<P>
Once these processes have been started, the system is running
normally, and bootstrap processing terminates.
