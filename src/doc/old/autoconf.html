<TITLE>Automatic Kernel Configuration</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
This note describes the automatic kernel configuration facility in
EROS.
<P>
<H1>1. The Objective</H1>
<P>
The EROS kernel is fully event driven.  Hardware and software
interrupts are encapsulated as <STRONG>Event</STRONG> objects, which
are dispatched to event handlers.  The objective of autoconfiguration
is to identify all of the event handlers that are present in a given
machine, and to ensure that these handlers are properly initialized.
Event handlers can be defined for processor exceptions, motherboard
components, hardware controllers, units on controllers, etc.
<P>
The wording above is carefully chosen.  Autoconfiguration must do more
than identify the sources of events, since a single event source may
have multiple associated handlers.  For example, a disk controller is
the source of disk interrupts, but the ultimate handler for these
interrupts is some unit.
<P>
The EROS design currently provides for two kinds of event handlers.  A
<STRONG>handler</STRONG> responds to events, but does not have an
associated Key invocation interface.  An example is the page fault
handler, which does not currently have any associated Key behavior.  A
<STRONG>device</STRONG> provides all of the functionality of a
handler, but in addition provides an externalized interface via one or
more keys.  Devices are a specialization of handlers.  All of these
handlers are initialized by the autoconfiguration mechanism.
<P>
While there are a very few kernel services that do not respond to
events, I deem it wiser to implement an empty OnEvent stub for those
services than to introduce multiple inheritance.  <EM>This decision is
subject to change</EM>.
<P>
On the face of it, autoconfiguration ought to be simple.  Determine
the busses implemented on your system, walk each bus looking for
devices, configure the devices, and proceed happily onward. 
Unfortunately, the PC architecture was never design with automatic
configuration in mind (thus the difficulties of Plug and Play), and
on some machines the configuration process must assign (in software)
configuration parameters dynamically depending on information
discovered elsewhere in the configuration process.
<P>
Just to add to the amusement, the probe procedures used to determine
if one device is present will sometimes lock up another device
completely.  On the PC, this is particularly true of ethernet cards
and sound cards.
<P>
The saving grace is that the arrival of Plug and Play is finally
beginning to dig us out of this mess.  Eventually we may be able to
disregard ISA configuration altogether, but simply knowing that new
machines are PCI-based is a big help.
<H1>An Architecture for Configuration</H1>
<P>
Configuration itself is clearly machine dependent, but it would be
very convenient to arrive at a configuration architecture that was
machine independent.  For a long time, I despaired of ever finding
such an architecture.  With some trepidation, I am now inclined to
think that EROS has accomplished this.  At the moment, the
architecture has been fleshed out for tightly and closely coupled
multiprocessor architectures.  While I believe that EROS might be an
interesting choice of node executive in a massively parallel machine,
I have not given such architectures any great amount of thought.
<P>
Backwards compatibility introduces an added complication.  The good
news is that the backwards compatible bus must be software compatible
at the level of I/O mapping and programmability.  The bad news is that
there are often ordering dependencies in how things are initialized.
In the case of the PC,   while the
backwards compatible bus is elect

One thing to keep in mind here is that we are concerned with the
software aspects of configuration, and that there

The EROS configuration mechanism views the machine hardware as a
hierarchy.  As an example, we show the abstract bus hierarchy for the
PC family:

In practice, of course, a machine will have either ISA or EISA busses,
but not both (the difference is one of addre

Configuration mechanisms vary widely from bus to bus, and
from controller to controller.  In addition, there are issues of
multiprocessors.  Logically, however, we can think of a TCMP Ignoring,
