<TITLE>Driver Initialization in EROS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
This note describes the EROS kernel driver logic.  At the moment, I"m
particularly focused on how drivers are initialized at boot time, but
the note includes an overview of kernel drivers in general.
<P>
<H1>1. Overview: Types of EROS Drivers</H1>
<P>
An EROS driver is any piece of code that responds to a hardware event
interrupt or implements a user-callable key.  This includes devices
and few kernel-implemented services (such as
<STRONG>discrim</STRONG>).  Ignoring the initialization entry points,
each driver has two primary external interfaces:
<STRONG>OnIntr</STRONG> and <STRONG>OnKeyCall</STRONG>.  These are
invoked, respectively, when an interrupt registered to that driver has
occurred or a user has invoked a key implemented by the driver.  All
drivers are derived from a common <STRONG>Driver</STRONG> superclass.
<P>
Protection fault handlers are also implemented using the driver
mechanism.
<P>
Drivers often have multiple instances.  In a system with two SCSI
controllers, each card will have a distinct SCSI driver instance in
the kernel.  If the driver instance manages a device that generates
interrupts, the instance will register itself with interrupt
dispatcher at initialization time.  Driver instances are either
well-known to the kernel (e.g. number key driver) or are miscellaneous
keys.  Miscellaneous keys are registered in a central kernel table.
The table entry number corresponds to the key's miscellaneous type
value.
<H2>Disk Drivers</H2>
<P>
In a system with persistent store, disk devices have a much closer
relationship to the kernel than other devices.  While these devices
implement the <STRONG>OnIntr</STRONG> and <STRONG>OnKeyCall</STRONG>
entry points, they also implement disk read and write entry points.
Disk driver implementations in EROS are derived from
<STRONG>DiskDriver</STRONG>, which is in turn derived from the basic
<STRONG>Driver</STRONG> class.
<H1>Driver Initialization</H1>
On startup, the kernel establishes a basic memory map and proceeds to
initialize all of the drivers that are present in the system.  This
involves asking each driver to probe the system looking for devices,
allocating driver storage for those devices that are found, and
setting the associated devices to a known state.
<H2>Order of Initialization</H2>
<P>
On most machines, there are ordering constraints on how drivers are
initialized.  For example, the system timer must be initialized before
almost anything else, since many other drivers make use of watchdog
timers.
<P>
There are also some less obvious constraints.  Not all controllers are
friendly to autoconfiguration, so it is sometimes important to probe
for one kind of board before another.  On the i386, for example,
ethernet boards are (in)famous for locking up if probed in certain
ways.  Unfortunately, the usual CD-ROM controller probe logic locks up
the ethernet boards.  The solution is to probe for the ethernet boards
first.
<P>
In order to support this, the driver initialization logic makes
several passes.  Each driver is marked with the pass in which its
initialization should occur.
<H1>Cascaded Devices</H1>
Some cards, in particular disk drives, can support a variable number
of devices.  In general, the kernel is built to assume the maximum,
and unused drivers deconfigure themselves during initalization.  In a
few cases, however, the variations are too many for this to make much
sense.  One interesting case is DOS disk partitions.
<P>
A DOS SCSI controller can have up to 7 devices, per the SCSI standard.
Each of these devices can supply an arbitrary number of partitions.
