<TITLE>Kernel Mapping in EROS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
EROS processes are given what appears to be an unrestricted 32-bit
address space.  Many architectures require that the interrupt handlers
be mapped in the process address space.  This note describes the
mechanism by which these two conflicting requirements are
simultaneously met by the EROS kernel.
<P>
<H1>1. The Problem: Virtual Interrupt Vectors</H1>
<P>
Many architectures, including MIPS, SPARC, 88K, and x86, use virtual
addresses for interrupt vectors.  When an external interrupt is taken,
the processor is placed in supervisor mode and the virtual address is
translated through the per-process address space.
<P>
The architectural assumption behind this choice is that there is a
single operating system shared by all processes, and that it occupies
some well-defined portion of the virtual address map that is common to
all processes.  Typically, the operating system will reserve a part of
the very top or very bottom of the address space.  Because
applications are relocated in ways that are sensitive to these
reserved spaces, the address space allocation becomes a compatibility
problem.
<P>
Reserved ranges combine with virtual interrupt vectors to create
conflicting requirements:
<OL>
<LI>
EROS <EM>must not</EM> reserve any portion of the virtual
address space. Any range that EROS might reserve will conflict
with the relocation assumptions of some operating environment.
<P>
<LI>
EROS <EM>must</EM> reserve some portion of the virtual address
space.  If it does not, the system will not be able to take
interrupts.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
In addition to these constraints, it is desirable to have a simple,
invertable mapping from kernel virtual addresses to physical addresses
and back.  This suggests that the kernel virtual mapping should be
constructed by adding some constant to the physical addresses.  The
constant should be chosen to place the kernel at a virtual address
that will minimize conflicts with other operating environments.
<P>
Believe it or not, all of these constraints can be satisfied
simultaneously. The solution is tricky, but conceptually suitable to any
of the architectures listed above.
<P>
While the following description is couched in terms of the i386
architecture, the solution avoids architecture-specific features.
<H1>2. Mapping on the 386 Family</H1>
<P>
The 386 family adds insult to injury by imposing hardware constraints
that need to be considered.  A few of the 386 DMA channels can only
address the lowest 1 Mbyte of physical RAM.  The remainder can address
the first 16 Mbytes.  Since a substantial portion of the first 1 Mbyte
is taken up by cards, it's fairly important not to put the kernel at
those addresses.
<P>
My compromise was to load the kernel at (physical) 1 Megabyte.  If the
machine has less than 1 Mbyte of memory, this version of EROS will not
run.  I know how to fix that, but given the way machines are being
configured these days it hardly seems urgent.  This choice avoids the
critical low memory area, but eats a small portion of the 16 Mbyte
addressable area.
As an incidental benefit, the BIOS area remains untouched, so it is
possible for the kernel to call the BIOS if we want to in the future.
<P>
The next challenge is to choose the kernel's virtual address.  Most
x86 applications, including EROS domains, use the low half of the
address map.  Windows 95 gives applications the low 3 Gbytes. After
some thought, I decided to build a virtual map that maps physical
memory beginning at 3 Gbytes.  Under this plan, the kernel is linked
to start at 0xC0101000.  The page at 0xC0000000 is reserved for use by
interrupt <STRONG>trampoline</STRONG> code, which is described below.
<P>
In order to enter the kernel, the bootstrap code creates a temporary
virtual map for the low 4 Mbytes of physical memory.  This area is
mapped at both virtual address 0x0 <EM>and</EM> virtual address
0xC0000000.  4 Mbytes gives the kernel enough room to construct a
permanent kernel mapping.  The dual mapping allows arguments to be
transferred from the bootstrap code to the kernel.
<P>
The end result is that virtual to physical translation is very simple,
and kernel virtual addresses are unlikely to conflict with most x86
applications.  The kernel lives in its own address space, but in most
cases it is also mapped into the high area of every process.
<H2>The Trampoline</H2>
<P>
When it comes to computing, there may be many Gods, but
Murphy speaks for all of them.  No matter what virtual address is
chosen for the EROS kernel, someone will build a process that uses
that address.
<P>
In the interest of getting an initial version up and running quickly,
EROS processes are only granted access to the first 3 Gbytes of their
address space segment.  <EM>This is a bug.</EM>  It will be fixed in a
future release, and I am outlining the solution here to make sure it
doesn't get lost.
<P>
If an application maps an address occupied by the kernel, the kernel
must be made to get out of the way.  To do this, the kernel supplies
several sets of interrupt entry points that appear at different
virtual addresses.  These secondary entry points are known as
<STRONG>trampoline</STRONG> entry points.  They are just smart enough
to save the critical interrupt information, load the official kernel
address space, and branch to the normal entry point.  The trampoline
code takes advantage of the fact that the kernel root page table
resides at a well known physical address.
