<TITLE>The EROS Disk Boot Process</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
This document describes the machine independent portion of the EROS
boot process.  It describes the structure of an EROS disk and the
actions taken by the EROS kernel once the kernel is entered.  The
details of how the kernel itself gets loaded are highly machine
dependent, and are described in machine-specific notes.
<P>
<H1>1. Structure of an EROS Volume</H1>
<P>
An EROS volume is a logical disk.  On an EROS-formatted floppy, the
volume spans the entire disk.  On hard disks things are a bit more
complicated.   Typically, the system firmware is designed to allow
multiple independent operating systems to be loaded onto a single
disk.  The disk is divided into non-overlapping regions, typically
called <STRONG>partitions</STRONG>, and each operating system acts for
the most part as it's partition was a single disk.  EROS is no
different; it views it's partition as a single volume, and largely
ignores the rest of the disk.
<P>
Every EROS volume is divided into one or more non-overlapping areas.
To avoid collision with firmware terminology, we use the term
<STRONG>division</STRONG>.  Divisions come in several types:
<PRE>
Unused      Empty. Placeholder for unallocated space.
Boot        Contains the system-dependent boot code.
DivTbl      A table describing the division layout.
Kernel      The kernel's code.
Spare       Division containing spare sectors.
Swap        A swap area.
Page        Holds EROS Pages.
Node        Holds EROS Nodes.
FailStart   Names the process to start if all else fails
</PRE>
<P>
The FailStart entry does not name a division on the disk.  Rather, it
is a pseudo-entry used to bootstrap the system.  It's use is described
in detail below.  Every volume has exactly one boot division at sector
0.  Every volume has <EM>at most one</EM> kernel division.
<P>
Every disk technology that we know about reserves sector 0 of a
partition the "boot sector."  The EROS boot sector has reserved
locations from which the locations of the primary (and optional
secondary) division tables can be read.
<P>
For each division, the division table describes the type, the starting
sector, the ending sector, and a unique system identifier.  If the
division is a Node, Page, or Swap division, the division table also
contains the starting CDA or SwapLoc of the division.
<P>
The Spare division is used to hold replacement sectors for defective
media.  The mapping from old (bad) sectors to sectors in the spare
area lives in the division table following the division list.
<H1>2. Formatting the Disk</H1> 
<P>
An EROS disk is formatted according to a volume map.  The volume map
is essentially a human-readable version of the division table to be
created.  It describes the start and end of each division, and for
some divisions it provides the file that should be used to initialize
that division (for example: the file containing the code for the boot
sector).
<P>
As an EROS volume is formatted, a list of bad sectors is accumulated
by the formatting program.  Bad sectors that are found in Page, Node,
or Swap divisions are added to the BadMap.  Bad sectors that are found
in other types of divisions cause formatting to fail.  Usually these
failures can be worked around by rearranging the volume map to avoid
the bad sectors.
<H1>3. The Boot Process</H1>
<P>
When the machine is powered up or reset, the firmware determines which
volume (disk or partition) will be booted.  Though the details are
machine specific, the firmware typically proceeds by loading a small
machine-dependent boot sector from sector 0 of the boot volume.
Usually, the boot sector must first load a larger bootstrap routine,
which in turn examines the volume map and loads the kernel itself.
At this point, the EROS kernel proceeds with it's own startup
procedure.
<P>
At a high level, the EROS kernel startup proceeds as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Perform the minimum required hardware initialization.
<LI>
Determine the unique system identifier (USID) of the running kernel.
<LI>
Locate and mount all divisions on all disks whose USID matches the
USID of the running kernel.
<LI> 
Locate the run list and begin executing the running processes.  The
run list can come from one of two locations:
<UL>
<LI> 
If a swap areas has been located, the list of running processes is
obtained from the most recent valid checkpoint image in the swap area.
<LI> 
If no swap area exists, the FailStart entries in the boot volume's
division table constitute the running process list.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
The net effect of this is that EROS will restart the existing system
image if possible.  If no existing system image can be found, it will
load a minimal system starting set.  The intention is that this
minimal process set will be sufficient to enable system recovery.
<P>
There are two security-related assumptions embedded in this bootstrap
mechanism:
<UL>
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the boot media,
the system is not secure.
<LI>
If unauthorized users are able to physically access the system
console, and the swap area(s) have been damaged or do not exist, the
system is not secure.
</UL>
<P>
The intent of the FailStart mechanism is to simplify initial
installation of the system.  It eliminates the need to construct a
swap area on the installation floppy.  Being able to run the kernel
before the swapping logic has been debugged greatly simplifies initial
testing.
<P>
Some other potential uses of the FailStart mechanism include:
<UL>
<LI> 
Degrading gracefully when a swap device cannot be found because it is
offline.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Recovering from sector 0 failures on non-boot volumes.
<EM>This is not implemented.</EM>
<LI>
Implementing system startup in embedded systems that boot from a ROM
and do not have a swap area at all.
</UL>
<P>
The FailStart mechanism was not present in the KeyKOS system.  It's
uses and abuses have not been fully explored.
<H2>3.1. Finding the Unique System Identifier</H2>
<P>
When the EROS kernel starts up, it performs some minimal hardware
initialization and then locates the boot volume.  It loads the boot
sector to learn the location of the division table on the boot volume,
and then loads the division table itself.  From the kernel entry in
the division table, it learns the system id of the kernel that was
booted.
<P>
<I>An alternative would be to have the system ID passed to the kernel
by the bootstrap routine, which has the information available in any
case.</I>
<H2>3.2. Mounting the Divisions</H2>
<P>
Having determined the unique system identifier, the kernel now loads
the master partition table of every disk, and searches for EROS
volumes.  For every EROS volume that it finds, it loads the division
table.  For every Page, Node, and Swap division whose USID matches
that of the running system, the division is mounted and the pages and
nodes in that division are made available to the object loading
subsystem.
<H2>3.3. Finding the Run List</H2>
<P>
Once all of the divisions are known, the kernel must locate the list
of processes to run.  If a swap area is available, the run list is
loaded from the swap area.  If no swap area is available, then the
FailStart entries from the boot volume's division table are used.  The
processes named in the run list are swapped in and scheduled.
<P>
Once these processes have been started, the system is running
normally, and bootstrap processing terminates.
