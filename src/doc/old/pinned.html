<TITLE>Support for Pinned Pages and Nodes</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
One of the changes between EROS and KeyKOS is support for pinned
processes.  EROS is designed to support time-critical applications
that cannot be swapped out of memory.  This note describes how that
mechanism works, and how it interacts with system startup.
<P>
All Pages and Nodes whose CDA's upper halfword value is 2^16-1 are
<EM>pinned</EM>. The magnitude of the pinned range is deliberately
chosen to span more physical memory than any real 32 bit machine is
likely to have installed.
<P>
Once loaded, pages and nodes in this range will never be placed on the
free list.  Pinned pages and nodes are checkpointed by the usual EROS
mechanisms, but will never be removed from memory.  Processes that
must be locked in core should therefore be constructed from Nodes and
Pages in this range.  Pages and Nodes in the pinned range are handled
with a dedicated space bank.
<P>
Processes whose correct operation depends on their being pinned in
memory must run under a schedule key whose "pinned" bit is set.  A
process that is pinned and runnable will not be executed until all
pinned pages and nodes that have actually been allocated have been
loaded into memory.
<P>
At system startup time, a special startup task is executed that holds
a key to the pinned space bank.  When the system starts up, this task
tells invokes the pined space space bank with a request to fault in
all of the pages and nodes in the pinned range that have actually been
allocated.  Once this has been completed, the task tells the kernel
that it is okay to run pinned processes.
<P>
The net result is that pinned processes will not resume until all
pinned pages and nodes have been reloaded.
