<h1 align=right>Preface</h1>
<p> This document describes the architecture and design of the EROS
kernel from the standpoint of the kernel designer.
The focal audience for this document
includes:
<ul>
  <li> Myself, as the designer of the EROS kernel,
  <li> The EROS team here at the University of Pennsylvania,
  <li> Developers seeking to port the kernel to other architectures,
  <li> Real-time system implementors who need to understand the design
       and workings of the kernel,
  <li> Driver writers who wish to understand the context in which EROS
       drivers operate, and 
  <li> Students interested in the design of a highly-reliable system.
</ul>
<p> EROS has been through several major design iterations, and each
has benefitted from my attempts to capture the design in writing.  I
am crafting this final design document because I am trying to get my
thesis effort completed, and do not have time to do the job twice.
While this document includes some explanatory material, it is not
intended to be tutorial in nature.  The reader is assumed to have a
strong background in operating systems.  At a later time I expect that
we shall put together a book combining the content of this document
and extensive elaboration with the source code itself.

<h2>What is EROS?</h2>
<p> EROS is a high-performance, secure, real-time kernel.  It's design
borrows heavily from the KeyKOS system, which was commercially
deployed but never received wide acceptance.  Like KeyKOS, EROS is a
pure capability system.  Capabilities provide the sole naming
mechanism known to the kernel, and authority is conveyed exclusively
through the use of kernel-protected capabilities.
<p> The design of the EROS system borrows heavily from the attitudes
and philosophy of microkernel-style designs. The system design can be
divided into three tiers:
<ol>
  <li> The <em>kernel core</em>, which contains all performance
       critical paths and performs all machine-specific functions.
       State managed by the kernel core is layed out and structured
       according to the needs of the implementation architecture.
  <li> The <em>object cache</em>, which provides a single-level object
       store and implements the EROS object model.  State managed by
       the object cache is in machine-independent form.
  <li> The <em>persistence architecture</em>, which provides
       recoverable transparent persistence and a logging mechanism
       suitable for transaction support.
</ol>
<p> The kernel core includes the content of a classical microkernel,
including scheduling, address space management, system service
dispatch, and IPC primitives.  The object cache provides a
machine-independent representation for application resources, which
allows detailed space accounting policies to be efficiently enforced.
The persistence architecture adds recoverable persistence, allowing
applications to resume from a consistent snapshot in the event of
system failure.
<p> The division described is not merely pedagogical.  The principle
difference between EROS/Lite and the full EROS system is the
elimination of the persistence architecture.  In the absence of the
persistence architecture, EROS is fully real-time, and offers better
resource accounting and control than most functionally comparable
systems. The EROS/Lite system is therefore well suited to
non-persistent embedded applications where reliability is a principle
concern.
<p> In fact, the EROS architecture allows three distinct approaches to
persistence:
<ul>
  <li> No persitence.  The kernel does not include support for
       persistence and the associated drivers.
  <li> Explicit persistence. Applications may arrange explicitly for
       the transfer of dirty objects to disk, but transparent
       persistence is disabled.  Dirty objects remain in memory until
       explicitly flushed to disk.
  <li> Transparent persistence, in which objects are recoverably saved
       to persistent store without explicit action by the
       application.  With proper planning, transparent persistence can
       be implemented in a real-time system.
</ul>

<h2>Why EROS?</h2>
<p> While we could offer a long set of excuses for constructing a new
operating system, it seems wiser to confine ourselves to an
observation made by Elliott Organick in 1983:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The failure to solve the general protection problem by prior
  architectures (descriptor based or not) has had serious
  consequences.  It has meant, for example, that system software
  modules must be set apart and explicitly protected from application
  programs; the former cannot be permitted to <em>trust</em> the
  integrity of in-bound pointer arguments such as descriptors.  This
  dispartiy has, in turn, made it imptactical and unsage to permit
  users the freedom to substitute their own versions of selected
  modules.  A frequent consequence has been that much software within
  a system tends to be relegated to a small number of very large
  (monolithic) <em>protection domains</em>.  This consequence, in
  turn, leads to high software maintenance costs.

</blockquote>
<p>
<!--  Organick's comments are novel only for being so clearly stated.
Protection wasn't a new problem then, and it remains essentially
unsolved in today's computing systems. -->
<p> No widely available operating system today adequately solves the
general protection problem.  As a result, these systems lack a number
of critical features:
<p> 
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Graceful degradation</em> - When the going gets tough,
       today's operating systems either crash or kill user programs.
       This reflects some basic flaws in their underlying design.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Reliability</em> - Today's systems are embarassingly
       unreliable.  A top of the line UNIX server, carefully
       administered, may continue running for as long as one month
       between crashes.  Failure times for other mainstream operating
       systems are comparable.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Security</em> - We have invested a great deal of effort
       into the so-called ``Orange Book'' security levels, which are
       concerned with access prevention.  The real-world goal is not
       to prevent all access to a system, but to provide carefully
       controlled access in a hostile environment.  This is a much
       harder problem, and today's systems really aren't designed for
       it.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Accountability</em> - Only when resources are fully
       acounted for does it become possible to speak about the
       reliability of a systme.  The EROS model makes it relatively
       easy to manage resources without unduly complicating applications.
</ul>

<H2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p> Quite a number of people deserve thanks and acknowledgement for
their efforts and support in connection with the EROS project:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Norm Hardy</strong> is the primary architect of KeyKOS,
       from which EROS borrows.  Along with <strong>Bill
       Frantz</strong> and <strong>Charlie Landau</strong>, Norm has
       actively engaged in the discussions leading to the current EROS
       system.  Norm in particular has spent countless hours sharing
       his insights into KeyKOS in particular and capability systems
       in general.
  <li> <strong>Jonathan Smith</strong> and <strong>Dave
       Farber</strong> have provided continual support and advice in
       connection with this project.
  <li><strong>Mike Berry</strong> Has done a lot of work toward the
       design and implementation of dionysix,, and I'm hoping that he
       will continue in this direction.  Would that every teacher
       could have the benefit of such students.
  <li> <strong>Bryan Ford</strong> of the University of Utah has also
       put forward a lot of useful ideas.  His thoughts and
       suggestions at various points were pivotal, and his experience
       with the Intel architecture was extremely helpful in building
       the first implementation.
  <li> <strong>Ben Chen</strong> did the early ethernet driver
       support, in the process helping to debug a number of issues in
       device support.
  <li> <strong>Charles Smith</strong> of Filoli Information Systems
       provided an odd sort of moral support.  Though he often claimed
       that he couldn't figure out why I thought <em>I</em> should be
       doing this, he simultaneously maintained that building EROS was
       a good idea and should be pursued.
</ul>
<p>There are many others who ought to be thanked as well; too many to
name all of them individually.
