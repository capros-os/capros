<h1 align=right>EROS Overview</h1>
<p> There are a lot of differences between EROS and most
commonly-known operating systems.  These differences significantly
impact the architecture and design of the EROS kernel.  From the
standpoint of the kernel design, the major differences between EROS
and other systems are:
<ul>
  <li> EROS is a pure capability system.
  <li> EROS is resource conserving.
  <li> EROS is transparently persistent.
  <li> Context switch and messaging are fast.
</ul>
<p> The implications of these issues are discussed below.
<hr>
<h2>A Pure Capability System</h2>
<p> EROS is a pure capability system.  A capability is an object name
combined with a set of access rights.  In the EROS system,
capabilities are protected by the kernel.  Only the kernel has access
to the bits of a capability, and it is the responsibility of the
kernel to enforce the authority restrictions that a capability
conveys.
<p> A capability uniquely names a device, a kernel-provided service,
or the location and type of an object on the disk, and identifies the
access rights conveyed by that capability.  Capabilities provide the
<em>only</em> namespace and security mechanism known to the EROS
kernel.  Posession of a capability is a necessary and sufficient
condition for using it; the kernel has no understanding of user
identity.  Capabilities are invoked via the EROS IPC mechanism.  The
caller names the capability to be invoked, the type of invocation, and
any desired arguments and return values.  While it is possible (indeed
common) to build the equivalent of conventional file systems on top of
the substrate provided by the EROS kernel, the kernel has no knowledge
of the semantics and/or authority models of these systems.
<p> Disk-based objects have one of two representations: \textbf{pages}
are the basic unit of user data storage, and contain an
architecture-defined amount of user data. \textbf{Cgroups} are the
basic unit of capability storage, and hold 16 capabilities.  Other
disk-based object types, such as domains and segments, are created by
assembling cgroups in well-defined arrangements and fabricating a
capability whose type indicates the type of the object.
<p> In the kernel design presented here, capabilities have meaning
within a single host node, and are never exposed to the network.
While we have a design for implementing a transparently persistent
cluster the provides a single system image, that design is not
described by this document.
<hr>
<h2>Resources are Conserved</h2>
<p> It is a common practice in current operating systems to
overallocate resources and rely on the fact that they will not all
actually be demanded at once.  One example is dynamic allocation of
memory within the operating system.  While it is unlikely that all OS
components will need resources at the same time, it is surprisingly
easy for fragmentation to take hold.  In the limit, this can lead to
deadlock.
<p> Another example is swap space.  Typical operating systems rely on
the fact that only a fraction of most memory mappings will be dirtied,
and that only dirty pages really require stack space.  They
accordingly overcommit the available swap space, and are sometimes
forced to kill hapless programs when they get caught.  Given the
current cost of disk storage, the original economic arguments in favor
of this approach are obsolete.
<p> The major problem with resource overallocation deadlocks is that
(by definition) they occur during exceptional situations.  Usually,
these are the <em>exactly</em> those situations in which it is most
important for your system not to fail. I'm not sure there is a good
time for memory allocation deadlocks.  Taking one when the control
rods need to go into the nuclear core to avoid a meltdown definitely
isn't it.
<p> A key point to keep in mind about resource overallocation is that
it violates referential integrity.  The system has handed you a bunch
of resources that it is not necessarily able to deliver.  This means
that such errors cannot be corrected or readily worked around by
software above the kernel in a general purpose computing system.
<p> As a design principle, The EROS kernel does not overcommit
resources.  For this reason, we say that the kernel is
<strong>resource conservative</strong>.  Applications are still free
to manage resources badly.  Under EROS, it is possible in for them to
manage resources well.
<p> Resource conservation has some implications:
<ul>
  <li> Processes can become broken, but they are not demolished by the
       kernel.  That is a user-level responsibility.
  <li> The kernel therefore cannot directly respond to fatal execution
       errors.  Instead, it encapsulates them and reflects them to an
       application-defined error handler known as a
       <strong>domain keeper</strong>.
  <li> The eros kernel implements a write ahead log to support paging
       and rollback, but does not allocate swap space.  Access faults,
       including not-present pages, are reflected to a segment-defined
       error handled known as a <strong>segment keeper</strong>
</ul>
<p> We like to say that "The kernel neither creates nor destroys
resources."  There is currently one exception to this rule (certain
exception handling requires the temporary allocation of a new thread),
and we consider this a bug.
<p> Eliminating resource allocation has a desirable secondary
consequences: if you don't misallocate resources in the first place,
there is no need for complex recovery algorithms.  As complex as smart
allocation strategies are, they are generally linear in the number of
objects. The corresponding recovery algorithms are typically quadratic
or cubic in the number of objects, and are invariably run when the
system has already run out of computational headroom.  Fundamentally,
the existence of a resource recovery algorithm means that the resource
management policy was poorly thought out in the first place.
<p> EROS has no resource recovery code because it doesn't need it.
The only recovery code in the kernel is to resume after an underlying
hardware or power failure.
<hr>
<h2>EROS is Transparently Persistent</h2>
<p> EROS implements recoverable persistence by taking a periodic
snapshot of the system and asynchronously writing that snapshot to the
disk.  The critical part of this is the snapshot phase, which must
proceed while the system is otherwise frozen.  Snapshot is
accomplished by marking all objects in the system copy on write and
allowing the next eligible procss to attempt to resume execution.  The
supporting state tracking pervades the kernel data structures.
<p> Because the system can fail for reasons beyond it's control,
persistence is acheived by first writing a snapshot to a write-ahead
log, and then migrating the dirty objects back to their "official"
locations.  The EROS kernel implements what amounts to a write-ahead
transaction log to support this.
<hr>
<h2>Context Switch is Fast</h2>
<p> The entire EROS design is predicated on the assumption that
context switches can be performed quickly.  As a result, the single
most critical path in the kernel is the IPC path.  The IPC path
therefore has influence on the layout and content of the
process-related structures.
