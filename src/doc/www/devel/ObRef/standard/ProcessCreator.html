	    <h3>Description</h3>
	    <p>
	      The <strong>process creator</strong> is the basic tool for
	      building processes.  They are constructed by <a
		href="PCC.html">DCC</a>. Process creators exist primarily for use by
	      factories; most applications do not use process creators directly.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Every process creator has an associated <em>brand</em>, which is
	      unique to that process creator.  Every process root constructed by a
	      process creator contains this brand, allowing process creators to
	      identify their progeny.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      There are two types of process creator keys: one is full
	      featured, while the other does not permit the destruction of a
	      process.  This page describes both keys.
