  <h3>Description</h3> 
  <p> The <strong>Buffered Stream</strong> object provides a mechanism for
  transmitting a buffered, unidirectional stream of data.  Reader(s)
  and writer(s) may operate on the stream concurrently, and neither
  will block unless the buffer underflows (reader) or overflows
  (writer).
  <p> A buffered stream object contains a buffer of bounded size,
  initially one page.  The size of the buffer may be altered at run
  time.
  <p> To external appearances, the buffered stream object implements two
  keys: a writer key and a reader key.  The writer key is used to
  append data to the buffered stream.  The reader key is used to consume
  data from the buffered stream.  The writer key also conveys the
  authority to adjust the size of the buffer.
  <p> Internally, the buffered stream object is implemented as a trio of
  cooperating processes, using a commonly-held address space as a ring buffer:

  </center>
  <p> Unnecessary use of the semaphore object is avoided by having a
  shared page of state between reader and writer.  Reader and writer
  then use the following algorithms to avoid use of the semaphore
  where possible.  A circular buffer is used, ensuring that the
  algorithm described can be correctly executed given only an atomic
  word write operation.

	 a data value.  If the write is non-blocking, this may be less
	 than the number of bytes that were transmitted.
	 <p> The extended form of the write request differs from the

	 invoker with exclusive control over the write side of the
