  <h3>Description</h3> 
  <p> The <strong>Mutex</strong> object provides a mechanism for
  coordination over shared resources by providing a mechanism for
  mutual exclusion.  An actor (a process) that wishes to posess
  exclusive access to a resource first invokes the mutex object.  On
  return, the actor "owns" the mutex object, and holds a "relinquish"
  key to the mutex.  When the actor has completed it's operations, it
  calls the relinquish key to allow other actors to proceed.
  <p> It should be emphasized that the exclusion applies only to those
  processes that make use of the mutex object voluntarily.  The mutex
  object provides no mechanism for mutual exclusion among
  non-cooperating users.
  <p> A mutex object has two keys: the <strong>mutex request
  key</strong>, which is long lived, and the <strong>mutex release
  key</strong>, which lasts for the duration of a single exclusion.

  <h3>Operations</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt> <strong>Check Alleged Key Type</strong> (OC = KT)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Returns the alleged type of the key.  Note that checking
	 the alleged key type of a <strong>mutex relinquish
	 key</strong> has the side effect of releasing the mutex.
	 <table>

	       0x020000:
	       Key is a mutex request key.

	       Key is a mutex relinquish key.
	     </td>

	 </table>
	 <p> 
    <dt> <strong>Request Mutex</strong> (OC = 1)
    <dd>
	 <p> Requests ownership of a mutex object.  This operation may
	 be performed on either a mutex request key or a mutex
	 relinquish key, though it isn't terribly clever to ask for a
	 mutex you already hold.
	 <p> Returns a mutex relinquish key.
