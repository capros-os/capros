	    <h3>Description</h3>
	    <p>
	      For some programs, the precise details of invocation
	      semantics are important. This page provides a detailed
	      description of the invocation semantics.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      To invoke a key, a process sets up the message arguments
	      in it's registers and then performs a kernel trap.  When
	      this trap occurs, the kernel performs the following
	      steps:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Sender is prepared to send.
		</p>
		<ol type=A>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      The sender's data pages, if any, are checked to
		      be sure they are in-core and readable.
		    </p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      The invoked key is validated and converted to a
		      <a href="../kernel/Void.html"><strong>void
		      key</strong></a> if stale.
		    </p>
		  </li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		  NOTE that in order to be sending at all the sender
		  must be well-formed.  This implies that it has a key
		  registers node, which we may wish to reconsider.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The invoked key is checked to determine the
		  receiver, which may not necessarily be the sender.
		  If invoked key is a gate key, the, receiver must be
		  extracted from the key and loaded into context
		  cache.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  The recipient is prepared to receive.  The recipient
		  may not be well formed.
		</p>
		<ol type=A>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      If recipient has no key registers node, or is
		      otherwise malformed, what happens depends on the
		      invocation type:
		    </p>
		    <table>
		      <tr>
			<td><strong>fork, call</strong></td>
			<td>sender receives RC=KT+1</td>
		      </tr>
		      <tr>
			<td><strong>return</strong></td>
			<td>sender cannot detect failure</td>
		      </tr>
		    </table>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      If the recipient does not already have valid
		      data pages where the receive buffer should be
		      located, <em>and</em> is not currently faulted,
		      the following steps occur:
		    </p>
		    <ol type=i>
		      <li>
			<p>
			  If the recipient's address space keeper is
			  available, it is invoked with the usual
			  address space fault.  It is passed a fault
			  key to the <em>recipient</em> process.
			</p>
		      </li>
		      <li>
			<p>
			  The invocation is nullified.  The invoker
			  remains in the running state just prior to
			  the invocation, and is stalled on the
			  recipient's address space keeper.
			</p>
		      </li>
		    </ol> 
		  </li>
		</ol>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  By this point, a message structure has been
		  constructed and the key can be invoked.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Sent keys and data are logically copied into a
		  holding area.  No such holding area exists in the
		  kernel; this statement simply makes it well-defined
		  what happens when key sent keys or data are
		  overwritten by the reply.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  The key action is performed.  In the case of a gate
		  key this is simply a transferral of the thread to
		  the new process.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  Reply keys are delivered to the recipient.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Reply data is delivered to the recipient if delivery
		  would be <a href="Prompt.html">prompt.</a> If
		  delivery would not be prompt, the message is
		  discarded and the high bit of the recipient's fault
		  code is set to indicate loss of message data.
		  Delivery is non-prompt under the following
		  circumstances:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li> 
		    <p>
		      The recipient was faulted at the time of the
		      invocation.
		    </p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      The address space keeper declined to provide the
		      backing store for the receive buffer(s).
		    </p>
		  </li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The recipient is set running.  If it's fault code is
		  nonzero, it's process keeper will be invoked before
		  the recipient performs any units of operation.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <h3>Notes for Shared Services</h3>
	    <p>
	      An issue in the design of shared services is that they
	      must not be delayed by invoking a key that might block.
	      For this reason, the <strong>return</strong> operation
	      silently discards the reply if the destination
	      capability is not a resume capability. If it is desired
	      to return on a non-resume capability,
	      <strong>npreturn</strong> should be used instead.
