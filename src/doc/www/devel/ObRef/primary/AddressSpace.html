	    <h3>Description</h3>
	    <p>
	      An address space provides a mapping from offsets to
	      pages.  Address spaces are the mechanism of data
	      organization and access in the EROS system.  Address
	      spaces are constructed as a tree of Nodes whose leaves
	      are pages.  A description of how to build and use
	      address spaces can be found in the <a
	      href="../concepts/AddressSpaces.html">concepts</a>
	      section.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Address spaces are fabricated by the <a
		href="Node.html#makeseg"><em>Make Address Space
		Key</em></a> order on the <a
		href="Node.html"><strong>Node</strong></a> key.
	    </p>
	    <p> 
	      An address space key conveys the authority to read and
	      write the content of the address space.  Write access
	      can be prohibited by creating an address space key with
	      the <strong>read only</strong> attribute.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Address spaces come in two varieties: <em>black</em>
	      address spaces and <em>red</em> address spaces:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <table>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>Black Address Spaces</strong></td>
		  <td>
		    A black address space contains up to 32 subaddress
		    spaces, and act as the basic building blocks of an
		    address space tree.  Black address spaces are are
		    <em>non-callable</em> address spaces.
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>Red Address Spaces</strong></td>
		  <td> 
		    Red address spaces serve to provide complex structuring
		    and fault handling for address spaces by specifying keepers
		    and background address spaces, and other complexities.  An
		    address space key that names a red address space with a
		    keeper is callable <em>unless</em> the <strong>don't
		      call</strong> attribute of the address space key is set.
		  </td>
		</tr>
	      </table>
	    </ul>
	    <p> 
	      As with nodes, address spaces may carry read-only,
	      no-call, and weak access restrictions.  Information on
	      the read-only, no-call, and weak attributes can be found
	      on the <a href="Node.html"><strong>Node</strong></a>
	      page.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Every access to an address space has an associated
	      <em>responsible keeper</em> who will be notified in the
	      event of an access fault.  The responsible keeper is
	      determined by walking the address space from the root to
	      the leaves to locate the <em>most enclosing callable
	      keeper</em>.  The search terminates when a page is
	      reached or a "don't call" address space key is
	      encountered.  No keeper defined within the structure of
	      a don't call address space will be invoked by any access
	      to that address space.  If no other keeper can be found,
	      access faults are reported to the process keeper.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Callable</strong> address spaces are red
	      address spaces whose NC bit is 0 (permitting calls) and
	      which identify an address space keeper.  Invocations on
	      a callable address space key are reflected to the
	      associated keeper.  Callable address spaces therefore
	      respond to any protocol defined by their address space
	      keeper.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      All other address spaces respond only to the
	      <strong>Check Alleged Key Type</strong> and <strong>make
	      read only</strong> operations.  By convention, address
	      space keepers are expected to respond to the
	      <strong>Check Alleged Key Type</strong> and <strong>Make
	      Read Only</strong> requests in a fashion that is
	      consistent with the specification on this page; thus,
	      these requests may be used on any address space.
	    </p>
	    <h4>Red Address Spaces</h4>
	    <p> 
	      The contents of a red address space Node are interpreted
	      according to the <strong>format key</strong> that is
	      found in slot RedSegFormat (31). The format key is a
	      number key whose content is as follows:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <table>

		    precisely, slots in the range [0:I) will be
		    traversed according to the usual address space
		    traversal rules.  Slots whose number is >= I will
		    be assumed to hold <a
		    href="../kernel/Void.html"><strong>void
		    key</strong></a>s for purposes of ordinary
		    traversal.  This reserves these slots for use as
		    the background key or keeper key.

	      If the format key is <em>not</em> a number key, the

	    <h4>PROPOSED Red Address Spaces</h4>
	    <p>
	      <em>The problem with the existing red address space
		design is that it will not go to 32 slot nodes
		gracefully.  The following describes the proposed
		design, which is in the process of being
		implemented.</em>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The contents of a red address space Node are interpreted
	      according to a combination of predefined slot meanings
	      and value of the <strong>format key</strong> that is
	      found in slot 15.
	    </p>
	    <p> 
	      Every red address space has some number of
	      <strong>initial slots</strong> (<strong>I</strong>) that
	      are considered vaild for purposes of address space
	      traversal.  More precisely, slots in the range [0:I)
	      will be traversed according to the usual address space
	      traversal rules.  Traversals that pass through slots
	      whose number is >= I will cause invalid address
	      exceptions. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Every red address space also has some number of
	      <strong>reserved slots</strong> that are designated by
	      the EROS architecture for particular purposes:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
