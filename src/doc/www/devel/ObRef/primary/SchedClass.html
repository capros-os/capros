  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> A <strong>SchedClass Key</strong> conveys the authority to
  execute instructions under the resource allotment of a particular
  scheduling class.  Every process must posess a valid schedule key in
  order to execute instructions.  A general description of the EROS
  scheduling policy can be found in the <a
  href="../concepts/Scheduling.html">Scheduling</a> page of the
  concepts section.
  <p> <img src="../../../img/caution.gif" align=left> The
  implementation described here is a short-term placeholder intended
  to allow us to get programs running quickly.  We will be replacing
  it completely in the near future.
  <p> EROS currently supports three scheduling classes:
  <ul>
    <li> <em>important</em> threads receive a larger share of the
	 processor, and queue ahead of all lower classes.
    <li> <em>normal</em> threads receive a more limited share of
	 the processor, and queue ahead of idle processes
    <li> <em>idle</em> processes run when there is nothing better
	 to do.
  </ul>
  The current implementation is in fact a priority scheme, but this
  will change in the future.
  <p> No operations are currently defined on schedule keys.
