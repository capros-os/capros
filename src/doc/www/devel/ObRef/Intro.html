	    <p>
	      The EROS system is made up of a number of objects that
	      are interconnected to construct a complete, working
	      system.  This document provides a reference for all of
	      the objects that are supplied with the EROS system.  For
	      each object, the manual provides a specification of the
	      object's interface(s), a description of the behavior and
	      use of each interface, and (where applicable) cross
	      references to related objects and/or documents.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      An object interface is exercised by invoking an
	      appropriate <strong>key</strong>. The key names the
	      service provider, a particular interface to that
	      service, and the authority conveyed by the key.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For organizational purposes, this manual divides EROS
	      objects into four categories:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <table width=85%>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>Primary Objects</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Primary objects are stateful objects that are
		      directly implemented by the EROS kernel.  Their
		      content is saved to the disk by the checkpoint
		      mechanism.  Most objects and services, including
		      programs, are constructed out of primary
		      objects.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Primary objects are rescindable; the space bank
		      carries sufficient authority to invalidate
		      existing primary object keys.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>Kernel Objects</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Kernel objects provide interfaces to the EROS
		      kernel itself.  These objects are stateless, and
		      generally fall into one of two categories:
		    </p>
		    <ul>
		      <li>
			<p>
			  Services that require direct access to the
			  representation of a key, such as the
			  <strong>discrim</strong> key.
			</p>
		      </li>
		      <li> 
			<p>
			  Services that interact with or control the
			  single level store implementation, such as
			  the <strong>checkpoint</strong> key.
			</p>
		      </li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>
		      Kernel objects are not rescindable.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>Device Objects</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Device objects are the embodiment of
		      machine-specific hardware devices.  Unlike other
		      EROS keys, not all device keys retain their
		      validity across system restarts.  Terminal keys,
		      for example, are rescinded automatically as part
		      of the restart process.
		    </p>
		    <p> 
		      Device keys are not individually rescindable.

		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>Standard Processes</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Standard processes are those objects included
		      with the system that are <em>not</em>
		      implemented by the EROS kernel, but are
		      necessary or useful in the operation of the
		      system.  Standard processes include the
		      <strong>process creator, </strong> the
		      <strong>escrow agent agent</strong>, the
		      <strong>space bank</strong>, processes
		      implementing various policies for address space
		      and process exceptions, and the like.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Standard processes are constructed from primary
		      objects, and can be rescinded by rescinding
		      those objects.
		    </p>
		  </td>

	      </table>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      Some keys are more sensitive than others.  Keys whose
	      misuse can compromise the security of the system in
	      whole or in part are identified in this manual with the
	      label <kbd>TCB</kbd>:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <strong>Range (TCB)</strong>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      Such keys should not be held by processes that are outside of the
	      Trusted Computing Base.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Other keys do not impact system security, but their
	      availability is restricted for reasons of performance or
	      administrative control. Such keys are said to be
	      <em>closely held</em>, and are identified with the label
	      <kbd>Restricted</kbd>:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <strong>Checkpoint(Restricted)</strong>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      Certain keys are <em>closely held</em>, meaning that
	      they are used only by system processes that are part of
	      the trusted computing base.  Generally, these keys
	      provide access to kernel services that are not
	      appropriate for general use.  In the manual, such keys
	      are identified by the letters <kbd>TCB</kbd>.
	    </p>
	    <h2>1. Invocation</h2>
	    <p>
	      Object interfaces are exercised by invoking the
	      corresponding keys.  There are several types of
	      invocations, and every invocation follows a standard
	      message structure.
	    </p>
	    <h3>1.1. Invocation Types</h3>
	    <p>
	      EROS provides three types of invocations: <strong>call</strong>,
	      <strong>return</strong>, and <strong>fork</strong>:
	    </p>
	    <center>
	      <table width=85%>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <th align=left>
		    Invocation
		  </th>
		  <th align=left>
		    Description
		  </th>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>call</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      The <strong>call</strong> invocation is used to
		      invoke a service and wait for a reply.  Every
		      call receives at most one reply (there is no
		      guarantee that the recipient replies at all).
		      When a key is invoked by the call operation, the
		      kernel fabricates a <strong>resume key</strong>
		      that is unique to that call, and places the
		      caller in the <em>waiting</em> state.  The
		      caller will resume when its resume key is
		      invoked.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      While a call operation is usually performed on a
		      start key, this is not required.  Calls on
		      resume keys can be used to perform co-routine
		      style invocations.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>return</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      The <strong>return</strong> invocation is used
		      to respond to a call.  The returning process
		      is placed in the <em>available</em> state,
		      making it available for subsequent calls.  When
		      the process is next invoked, execution will pick
		      up just after the return instruction.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      An important fine point is that the returning
		      process need not be returning to its most recent
		      caller.  It is sometimes useful to hold on to a
		      resume key for later use and service some other
		      caller first.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      In addition, the return operation need not be
		      performed on a resume key.  A process can
		      forward a message to a downstream process by
		      returning to the downstream process and passing
		      the content of the received message.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Because returning on a resume key is by far the
		      most frequent case, and because the resume key
		      type check is significant from a security
		      perspective (invocations of resume keys never
		      block) in most cases, the return invocation
		      checks whether the invoked key is a resume
		      key. It is possible to perform a return on other
		      key types by using the <strong>npreturn</strong>
		      invocation. The <strong>npreturn</strong>
		      invocation is identical to the
		      <strong>return</strong> invocation with the
		      exception that it does not check the key
		      type. An <strong>npreturn</strong> operation can
		      therefore block indefinitely (for example, an
		      <strong>npreturn</strong> on a start key to a
		      non-available domain).
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td>
		    <strong>fork</strong>
		  </td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      The <strong>fork</strong> invocation is used to
		      send a message to a recipient without waiting
		      for a reply.  Both the invoking and the
		      receiving process are in the running state.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Unlike call and return operations, the fork
		      operation does not return any information to the
		      invoker.  As a result, the "response" portions
		      of the message structure are unused.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
	      </table>
	    </center>
	    <h3>1.2. Invocation Content</h3> 
	    <p>
	      Every invocation involves several pieces of information.
	      On most architectures, everything but the data buffer is
	      kept in machine registers.  On more constrained
	      architectures such as the Intel family, some of this
	      information may be obtained indirectly from a message
	      descriptor buffer.  The mapping of the logical calling
	      convention onto specific registers is architecture
	      specific.
	    </p>

		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Send registers 0 through 3.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      <em>Description</em> Every invocation passes
		      four registers from the caller to the recipient.
		      It is the responsibility of the application to
		      zero these registers prior to performing an
		      invocation if their contents should not be
		      transmitted.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      <em>Usage Convention</em> The first of these
		      registers (SR0) is used to hold the
		      <strong>order code</strong> or <strong>result
		      code</strong>.  The order code identifies the
		      operation to be performed by the service that
		      the capability names.  The result code describes
		      the outcome of the operation.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      In a <strong>call</strong> or
		      <strong>fork</strong> invocation, this field is
		      usually used to indicate the order code.  In a
		      <strong>return</strong> invocation, this field is
		      used to describe the result code.  Note that
		      other combinations of call, return, and fork may
		      find it convenient to make other uses of this
		      field, as in the case of request forwarding.

		    <p>
		      <em>Description</em> Every invocation passes
		      four registers from the caller to the recipient.
		      The recipient receives these four registers into
		      the receive registers.  On most architectures,
		      the send and receive registers are identical;
		      the transmitted registers are overwritten by the
		      invocation's completion.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      It is the responsibility of the application to
		      save and restore these registers around the
		      invocation if their values should not be

		      The <strong>key info</strong> field is filled in

		      will be populated with the value of the key info
		      field of that start key.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Use of distinct key info values allows a single
		      process to implement multiple interfaces that
		      convey different services or different access
		      right.  Since this field is populated by the
		      kernel, the receiving process may assume that
		      the key info field is unforgeable.

	    <h3>1.3. Common Operations</h3>
	    <p>
	      Some operations are so universal that it is useful to
	      have a convention for how these operations are
	      requested.  These conventions are not enforced by EROS,
	      but it is a rare object that does not observe them.  By
	      convention, these operations are numbered relative to a
	      standard value for the <strong>Alleged Key Type</strong>
	      operation, <strong>KT</strong>.  The standard KT value
	      is the smallest number available under a two's
	      complement interpretation of the machine's natural word
	      size.  On a 32-bit architecture, this value is
	      -2,147,483,648, or 0x8000000.

		    by the object itself, which can therefore issue
		    any answer it pleases.  By convention, certain

	    <p>
	      This example describes a service that accepts a one-word
	      argument as data and returns a key in slot 0 of the
	      returned message.  The operation has two possible
	      outcomes: success or range error.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Several parts of both the request and the reply message
	      are ommitted from the description.  Keys 0 through 3 of
	      the request message are unused by this operation.  The
	      return values in Keys 1 through 3 are undefined, and no
	      data is returned.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In general, it is good practice to specify <a
	      href="kernel/Void.html"><strong>void key</strong></a>s
	      for unused key arguments.  This ensures that the
	      recipient does not gain access to authorities that it
	      shouldn't.  In addition, existing orders may be extended
	      in the future to interpret these slots, and planning
	      ahead by sending void keys in unused slots will prevent
	      incompatibility.  The interface glue layer provided for
	      C and C++ does this automatically.
	    </p>
	    <h3>2.1. Data Field Interpretation</h3>
	    <p>
	      While the data portion of the message is not interpreted
	      by the message transport, the reference manual specifies
	      the expected argument types for each invocation.  The
	      type of each argument is indicated by a preceding letter
	      within square braces, which may be one of the following:

	      Where an argument consists of a fixed length sequence of
	      items of like type, the type specifier may include an
	      optional colon followed by a count, as in
	      <kbd>[W:4]</kbd>. Where an argument consists of a
	      variable length sequence of items of like type, the type
	      specifier is followed by an asterisk, as in
	      <kbd>[S*]</kbd>.
