      Configuring a kernel consists of deciding which options, drivers
      and subsystems to include, which specific devices to define, and
      establishing values for some key kernel parameters.  This note
      describes how the configuration process works in EROS.  
      </p>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Configuring a kernel is complex and painful.  Certain devices do
      not autoconfigure gracefully at all.  Others configure fine, but
      can only be included if a supporting option is enabled.
      Different machines have different CPU's, and in some cases it is
      appropriate to build a kernel with CPU-specific dependencies.
      Knowing that the kernel will be run on a Pentium Pro as opposed
      to a Pentium makes a significant difference in how code is
      generated in a few critical paths.  Certain kernel files are not
      required unless the corresponding option has been enabled.
      Sometimes it is desirable to build multiple variants on the
      kernel simultaneously.n
      </p>
      <p>
      The BSD 4.4 kernel has a flexible configuration system, but it
      is extremely obscure.  For the most part, this obscurity is
      caused by two factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     Nobody has bothered to document it properly, so it is
	     hard to understand what it does.
	     </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     The BSD kernel design was predicated on the assumption
	     that controllers cannot be automatically identified and
	     configured by the kernel.  While there remain exceptional
	     controllers, this is no longer true for most
	     architectures.
	     </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      What is required is a configuration system that can describe the
      drivers and options to be included, and <em>where required</em>
      the specific device instances to be created.
      </p>
      <p>
      The current EROS configuration utility is a prototype, and is
      implemented in python.  This has proven convenient for
      experimentation, but has negative impacts on the syntax of the
      configuration input files.  I expect at some point to
      re-implement the configuration file parser using the kjParser
      package.  If necessary, I'll go to a yacc grammar, but that has
      its own problems; most notably it requires tools to be compiled
      prior to the kernel build.  The current build assumes that only
      a standard UNIX environment is required to start the kernel
      build, and I am reluctant to start another bootstrap directory
      hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Configuration Output</h2>
      <p>
      Before describing what the configuration input looks like, it's
      probably worth describing what the result of a successful
      configuration is.  Obviously, a successful configuration
      recognizes the devices that are present -- or at least the
      present devices that are supported by this kernel.  In addition,
      however, a configuration should yield an <em>equipment tree</em>
      that describes how these devices are hooked together.  As an
      example, here is the actual hardware configuration of the main
      EROS development machine:

</pre>
      <p>
      The goal of the configuration process is to build something that
      closely approximates this tree.  In practice, the configuration
      mechanism gets pretty close to building the tree as described,
      but in one area we have cheated: the primary disk interface.
      </p>
      <p>
      For the sake of BIOS compatibility, the PC architecture provides
      for an I/O register interface to the primary hard disk
      controller.  If this controller is a floppy, RLL, ST506, ESDI,
      or IDE controller, then it speaks primarily through this
      interface (possibly using supporting DMA logic if it sits on a
      PCI bus), and its presence is detected through the register
      interface.
      </p>
      <p>
      For SCSI controllers this presents a problem: we would like to
      know that the device in question is a SCSI device and speak to
      it accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
      To address this, all of the floppy, RLL, ST506, ESDI, and IDE
      cases are described as "block devices" in the configuration
      description.  Because block devices are configured after SCSI
      devices, the legacy register interface will prevail only if the
      controller has not already been detected as a SCSI controller.
      If a block device is present, the configuration procss makes a
      half-hearted attempt to attach the controller to the right bus
      if it is able to detect it.  Failing that, the controller will
      appear as a mainboard device.
      </p>
      <p>
      <IMG src="../../img/construction.gif" align=left> At present,
      the EROS kernel performs device configuration without actually
      building the device tree, because doing so was not essential for
      my thesis work.  The description above reflects where the
      implementation should go, and will when I get a chance to make
      it so.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Configuration File</h2>
      <p>
      The configuration file must accomplish four things:
      <ol>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     Identify the machine type, the processor
	     implementations to be supported, and the bus types to be
	     included.
	     </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     Define the options to be included in the constructed
	     kernel, if any.  If necessary, defining those options
	     that are specific to this machine.
	     </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     Define the drivers the devices that should be configured
	     into the kernel, and how they are hooked into the bus
	     hierarchy.  If necessary, this also describes any
	     appropriate constraints on the probe logic.
	     </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	     <p>
	     Specifying the files that will be compiled into the
	     kernel on the basis of the included options and devices.
	     </p>
	</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2.1 Describing the Machine, CPU, and Bus Types</h3>
      <p>
      The supported machines and their associated cpu types are known
      to the configuration utility.  Currently supported machines and
      CPUs are:
      </p>
      <center>
	<table width=85%>
	  <tr valign=top>
	    <th align=left>Machine</td>
	    <th align=left>CPU Types</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr valign=top>
	    <td>pc</td>
	    <td>i386, i486, pentium, ppro</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>
      <p>
      In the most complete machine definition for the PC, the
      supported machine and CPU types are described by the lines:
      <ul>
	<pre>
include("../../../config.common")
	
machine("pc")       # basic machine category

cpu("i386")         # ensure that each of these
cpu("i486")         # processor types is supported
cpu("pentium")
cpu("ppro")

bus(BT_PCI)         # handle machines including
#bus(BT_EISA)       # these bus types
bus(BT_ISA)
#bus(BT_SCSI)
#bus(BT_USB)
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The EISA bus is not supported at present, and likely never will
      be.  SCSI and USB support has not yet been implemented.
      <h3>2.2 Syntax</h3>
      <p>
	<pre>
defoption("name")
	</pre>
      declares that there is an option named OPTION_NAME.
	<pre>
defoption("name", 1)
	</pre>
      declares that there is an option named NAME.
	<pre>
option("name")
	</pre>
      declares that the above option is to be defined (as 1).
      </p>
      <p>
      Example: The PC provides a machine-specific kernel feature that is
      supported in a number of source files: small address spaces.
      Since this option is not general to all processors, it must be
      defined as an option for the PC family:
      <ul>
	<pre>
defoption("small_spaces")
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Having defined the options, the configuration file now specifies
      which options are to be included in this configuration:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<pre>
option("ddb")
option("small_spaces")
option("inet")
#option("npx")
#option("scsi")
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The set of machine-independent options is defined in the
      <tt>config.common</tt> file, included at the head of the
      configuration file.
      </p>
      <h3>2.3 Describe Configuration Templates</h3>
      <p>
      Having described the options supported and the options selected,
      the next step is to identify the driver templates to be included
      in this kernel.  For each driver, the associated bus type must
      be identified, and the probe restrictions, if any, must be
      described.  The commands for doing this are the
      <tt>base_template()</tt>, <tt>pci_template()</tt>,
      <tt>scsi_template()</tt>, <tt>isa_template()</tt>,
      <tt>eisa_template()</tt>, and <tt>usb_template()</tt>
      statements.  In addition, the basic kernel threads are
      configured here.  An abbreviated configuration file is shown
      below:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<pre>
#############################################
#
# Kernel threads
#
#############################################

base_template("checker")
base_template("idler")
base_template("twiddler")

#############################################
# NPX "device" is always present if option
# NPX is enabled, but in that case may be
# implemented in software.  This template
# lets us autoconfigure the emulation code
# if the NPX unit is not present.

if isoption("npx"):
   base_template("npx")

pci_template("3c59x")
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.4 Files to be Included</h3>
      <p>
      Based on the specified machine type, the configuration script
      examines the contents of a separate file describing how the
      kernel is to be compiled.  For the machine 'pc', the file
      examined if <tt>files.pc</tt>.  This configuration file contains
      a series of <tt>file(...)</tt> statements, that take one of two
      forms:
      <ul>
	<pre>
file("arch/i486/device/net_3c59x.cxx")
file("ddb/db_access.cxx", ddb)
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      More generally, the optional second argument can be any boolean
      expression.  Option names (such as 'ddb') may be used as though
      they were boolean variables.  Device configuration can be tested
      using <tt>ifdevice</tt>, as in
      </p>
      <ul>
	<pre>
file("arch/i486/device/net_3c59x.cxx", ifdevice("3c59x"))
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.5 Probe Controls</h3>
      <p>
      <IMG src="../../img/construction.gif" align=left> <em>The
      following is implemented, but unused and untested.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      Handling probe controls is more than a bit ugly.  Basically,
      what we need is a vector of values indicating the I/O ports,
      interrupt lines, and memory address to probe.  These are
      specified by writing a list into the template description:
      <ul>
	<pre>
base_template("ide", mem=[0xc8000, 0xd8000],
	      irq = [ 5, 7 ], port = [ 0x230, 0x250 ])
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      (Note that the example numbers are randomly selected).  Since in
      some cases there is exactly one legal IRQ value (usually
      coprocessors), a single IRQ value can be provided as an integer.
      </p>
      Allocating storage for a list for every device is prohibitive,
      so all such lists are merged into a single vector of integers,
      with entries separated by the distinguished value '-1'.  A
      device that should be probed for at I/O ports 5 and 10 and
      memory addresses 0xc8000 and 0xd8000 would generate the
      following entries in the probe vectors:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<pre>
int io_probe_vec[] = { ....., 5, 10, -1, .... };
int mem_probe_vec[] = { ....., 0xc8000, 0xd8000, -1, .... };
	</pre>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The device structure contains an int* pointer into this vector,
      whose value is zero if there is no device probe restriction.  If
      a device should not be probed at all, it should have a probe
      descriptor vector whose values are all -1.
      </p>
      <p>
      Interrupt options are handled a bit differently, as IRQ probing
      can be done by provoking an interrupt.  Instead, every device
      instance template holds an unsigned value that is a bit-vector
      describing which interrupts are acceptable.
      </p>
<!--       <h2>2. The Configuration Tree</h2> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       Devices and equipment on current computers follow a hierarchical -->
<!--       structure.  All of the actual equipment present descends from -->
<!--       the distinguished node <b>root</b>, which is the top of the -->

<!--       described. -->
<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       The configuration tree has four types of nodes.  These are -->

<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <p> -->

<!-- 	     <p> -->
<!-- 	     SCSI and IDE disks and tapes are commonly referred to as -->

<!--       <h2>3. The Configuration File</h2> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       The configuration file consists of a header, a definitions -->
<!--       section, a configuration section, and a files section.  By use -->
<!--       of an <b>include</b> directive, portions of the configuration -->
<!--       that are common to all platforms can be kept in separate files. -->
<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <h3>3.1 The Header</h3> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       The configuration header identifies the machine class that the -->
<!--       configuration covers, the processors to be supported, and the -->
<!--       (human readable) name of this configuration.  It also identifies  -->
<!--       any options associated with this configuration. -->
<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       The header section must begin with a <b>machine</b> declaration. -->
<!--       This describes the general category of machine being described. -->
<!--       The header must also provide at least one <b>cpu</b> statement, -->
<!--       indicating which processor type(s) are to be supported. -->
<!--       Recognized CPU types depend on the specified machine type. -->
<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       Following the <b>cpu</b> declaration, the header can declare one -->
<!--       (or more) <em>options</em> that apply to this configuration. -->
<!--       Options are used to describe software features that can be -->
<!--       optionally compiled into the EROS kernel. -->
<!--       </p> -->
<!--       <p> -->
<!--       Following the options section comes the pseudo-device section, -->
<!--       which describes the purely software ``devices'' that should be -->
<!--       included in the configuration. -->
<!--       </p> -->
