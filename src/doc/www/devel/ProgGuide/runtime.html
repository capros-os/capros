	    <h1 class=title>CapROS Runtime Environment</h1>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    <p>
	    This page provides a description of how the
	    standard native CapROS runtime mechanism works.
            The CapROS kernel is
	    not responsible for process construction; it is therefore
	    not a party to any runtime conventions about these
	    programs.
            <p> We first describe the runtime environment at the time
            the program's <code>main()</code> procedure is entered.
            Then we describe how the process is built and torn down. 
          <h2>1. Program Execution Environment</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Standard Program Execution Environment</h3>
	    <p>
	     When the program's <code>main()</code>
	    procedure is entered, the program has the following
	    initial capabilities in its capability registers.
            Declarations of these symbols are in 
            <code>&lt;domain/Runtime.h&gt;</code>.
	      <table>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_VOID</strong></td> <td>This key
		  register (register zero) <em>always</em> holds a void key.
		  This value is hard-wired, and cannot be changed by
		  the program.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_CONSTIT</strong></td>
		  <td>A <strong>read-only node key</strong> to the
		    process's initial services (i.e. to the
		  constituents node).
                    The constituents node is the principal means of
                    endowing a program with the specific capabilities
                    it needs.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_SELF</strong></td>
		  <td>A <strong>process key</strong> to the process
		    itself.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_CREATOR</strong></td>
		  <td>A start key to the process's <strong>process
		      creator</strong>. A process can use this to
                      tear itself down.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_BANK</strong></td>
		  <td>A key to the process's <strong>space
		      bank</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_SCHED</strong></td>
		  <td>A duplicate of the process's <strong>schedule
		      key</strong>.</td> 
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_RETURN</strong></td>
		  <td>A <strong>resume key</strong> to the process that
		    caused this process to be started.</td>
		</tr>
	      </table>
              <p> The process is free to use other key registers for its
                own purposes. You should not assume these registers
                are initially void; they may have keys left over from
                constructing the process.
                There are names and conventions for these key registers:
	      <table>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_APP(n)</strong></td>
		  <td>KR_APP(0), KR_APP(1), etc. are a set of key registers
                    typically used for long-term storage of keys.
                    Currently n can be up to 16, but it would be unwise to
                    count on more than about 14. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_TEMP0, KR_TEMP1, KR_TEMP2, KR_TEMP3</strong></td>
		  <td>Key registers for very short-term use.
                    The convention is that these should be used only
                    between procedure calls, or as parameters or results
                    of procedure calls.
                    In other words, you must assume that any procedure
                    you call may disturb these registers.
                    (IDL procedures (for example capros_Node_getSlot())
                    are a notable exception; they do not disturb any
                    key registers except those explicitly specified
                    as parameters.)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign=top>
		  <td><strong>KR_ARG(n)</strong></td>
		  <td>This convention may be dropped.
                    <em>What about parameters to the constructor?</em></td>
		</tr>
	      </table>
	      <p>
		The process initially has no keeper.
                Perhaps in the future there will be a way to define
                an initial keeper. 
	      </p>
            <p> Your main procedure should be declared as simply
              <code>int main(void)</code>.
              CapROS programs don't receive parameters via argc and argv.
	    <p> When the program is finished, it should destroy itself
              and if appropriate return to its caller (as described below),
              rather than return from <code>main()</code>.
              If the program does return from <code>main()</code>.
            the return code is discarded and the process is not torn down.
          <h3>1.2 Linux Program Execution Environment</h3>
            <p> Programs that run in the Linux kernel emulation environment have
              additional conventions.
              For example, some of the KR_APP(n) registers are used by the
              emulation.
              See the header file &lt;linuxk/lsync.h&gt; for details.
          <h3>1.3 Memory Allocation</h3>
            <p> There are two models of memory allocation used in CapROS.
              The initialization and teardown procedures are different
              for the two models. 
            <h4>1.3.1 Automatic Memory Allocation</h4>
	    <p>
              In this model, storage for bss, data, stack, and heap 
              is automatically allocated from a space bank when the
              storage is first referenced.
              This convenience comes at a cost; the address space
              consists of a VCS (Virtual Copy Segment) that gets control
              on page faults and uses copy-on-write techniques to 
              create the storage on demand. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
              There is one <em>important caveat</em> when using this model.
              If the process issues a capability invocation that receives
              a data string into memory, that memory cannot be automatically
              allocated. 
              (No page fault occurs, because the string is transferred
              under the control of the sending process.)
              If not previously allocated, the invocation will fail.
              Before receiving a string into memory, you must ensure
              that the memory is allocated by storing to each page in the
              string.
	    </p>
            <h4>1.3.2 Self-managed Memory Allocation</h4>
	    <p>
	      To minimize overhead, some programs may find it more
	      appropriate to manage their own memory. This is actually
              necessary to <em>implement</em> the richer environment.
	      Low overhead comes at the cost of correspondingly reduced runtime
	      support.
	    </p>
	    <p>
              In this model, storage for bss, data, and stack are allocated
              by the runtime system when the process is initialized
              (this is described below).
              If the process uses a heap, it must define its own
              <code>sbrk()</code> or <code>_sbrk()</code> procedures
              to manage heap storage.
              Most programs using this model don't require a heap.
	    </p>
	    <p>
              The stack does not grow, so the program must know
              in advance the amount of stack required. 
              Since program development tools seldom provide this
              information, the stack size must be conservatively estimated
              or determined experimentally.
	    </p>
	  <h2>2. Process Initialization</h2>
          <p> There are several variants of CapROS process initialization,
            to accommodate programs with various requirements. 
            Most programmers will not need to know this detail.
            It is documented here mainly because the information is hard
            to find elsewhere.
          <h3>2.1 Program linking</h3>
            <p> A basic understanding of how a CapROS program is linked
              into an executable file is needed to understand initialization.
              CapROS programs are linked using a cross-linker
              with some custom features. Look at the CapROS source code
              for some examples of how to use the cross-linker
              including required libraries.
            <p> The cross-linker automatically includes crt1.o which
              contains the first code executed in the program.
              Execution begins at the symbol <code>_start</code> and
              does the following:
              <ol>
              <li> Examine the variable <code>__rt_runtime_hook</code>
                 and if it is nonzero, branch to that address.
                 We'll see below how this is used.
              <li> Load the stack pointer with the contents of the
                 variable <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code>.
              <li> Call the procedure <code>__domain_startup</code>.
              <li> <code>__domain_startup</code> is responsible for
                initializing and finalizing the language environment.
                This is where C++ static constructors and destructors
                are called.
                This is done by calling <code>atexit(_fini)</code> and
                <code>_init()</code>, and then calling <code>exit</code>
                ater <code>main</code> has returned.
                <em>Implementation issue</em>:
                This logic is currently disabled, because <code>atexit</code>
                pulls in malloc and sbrk, which must be avoided in
                certain very low-level processes.
                Consequently C++ is not currently supported.
              <li> <code>__domain_startup</code> calls <code>main</code>.
              <li> In most cases <code>main</code> will never return.
	      When the program is finished, it should destroy itself
              and if appropriate return to its caller (as described below).
                If it does, <code>__domain_startup</code>
                passes the return code to <code>_exit</code>
                (rather than <code>exit</code>).
              <li> <code>_exit</code> performs an invocation on the
                process's own key (which must be in KR_SELF)
                that causes the process to stop running.
                The return code is discarded and the process is not torn down.
                <code>_exit</code> never returns.
              </ol>
            <p> The cross-linker also automatically includes crti.o and crtn.0
              which are used to build the <code>_init</code> and
              <code>_fini</code> procedures in the .init and .fini
              sections respectively.
          <h3>2.2 Linkage Models</h3>
          <h4>2.2.1 Small Linkage Model</h4>
            <p> The option <code>-small-space</code> instructs the linker to
            build a "small" address space. This means that the default locations
            for the program, stack, and heap are chosen to keep the
            address space compact, which improves efficiency. 
            In particular the address space can be represented in a single GPT.
            This option causes the linker to use the library option
            -lcapros-small. 
            <p> Currently, this option defines <code>__rt_runtime_hook</code>
            to point to a procedure that does the following:
            <ol>
              <li> If the variable <code>__rt_stack_pages</code> is nonzero,
              it specifies the number of pages of stack to create.
              The address space is cloned into a new GPT, the stack pages
              are allocated and installed in the new GPT at addresses
              0x1f000 and below, and
              the new GPT is installed as the process's address space.
              (This is tricky assembler code, because the process starts out
              with no read-write storage and must bootstrap itself.)
              <p> In this case the variable <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code>
              must contain 0x20000. 
              On the other hand, if <code>__rt_stack_pages</code> is zero,
              the stack must have been created already and
              <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code> must point to its bottom. 
              libcapros-small defines <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code>
              to be 0x20000; you can override this by defining it yourself.
              <li> The stack pointer is set to the value in 
              <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code>.
              <li> Pages for the .bss and .data sections are allocated
              and installed in the address space, and the .bss area
              is initialized. The .data area will be initially zero. 
              <li> We then go back to <code>_start</code>, after setting
              <code>__rt_runtime_hook</code> to zero so this procedure
              won't be repeated. 
            <p> This will probably change.
            </ol>
          <h4>2.2.2 Large Linkage Model</h4>
            <p> The option <code>-large-space</code> instructs the linker to
            build a "large" address space. This means that the default locations
            for the program, stack, and heap are chosen to maximize
            the space available for stack and heap.
            This option causes the linker to use the library option
            -lcapros-large. 
            This option is the default.
            <p> Currently, this option weakly defines
            <code>__rt_runtime_hook</code>
            as zero. The address space is assumed to be completely
            constructed before the process runs. 
            <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code> must contain the initial
            stack pointer. 
            libcapros-large defines <code>__rt_stack_pointer</code>
            to be 0x2000000 on ARM and 0x80000000 on x86;
            you can override this by defining it yourself.
          <h4>2.2.3 Small Address Spaces</h4>
            <p> On the IA32 architecture, the kernel currently has an
            optimization for address spaces that fit in the range
            [0, 0x20000). Processes with such address spaces
            enjoy better context switch efficiency.
            <p> On the ARM architecture, the kernel has an optimization 
            for address spaces that fit in the range
            [0, 0x2000000). Processes with such address spaces
            enjoy much better context switch efficiency, because
            the kernel uses the ARM Fast Context Switch Extension. 
          <h3>2.3 Initialization using the Constructor</h3>
          <p> CapROS programs are usually built by Constructors.
            To avoid having the Constructor busy longer than necessary,
            the new process's address space is built by the process itself.
	  <p>
	    To accomplish this bootstrapping, process fabrication is done by a
	    temporary program known as the <strong>protospace</strong>
	    from within the new process itself.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The first step in process construction is to allocate the new
	    process and initialize its key registers (as described above)
            and its schedule key.
            The new process's address space is set to a read-only
            immutable address space known as the <strong>protospace</strong>.
            The protospace program is part of the constructor logic.
            The constructor starts the new process running at the
            beginning of the protospace program.
	  </p>
            The protospace program supports two types of address space
            construction, depending on the nature of the key that was
            specified (to the Constructor) as the address space
            for new products. 
          <ul>
            <li> The specified address space key may be a constructor
              for an address space. If that key responds to a getType call
              by saying it is a constructor, then the protospace invokes
              the constructor to get an address space. 
              That address space is then installed
              as the process's address space, and the new program is started.
            <li> Otherwise, the specified address space key
              is installed directly
              as the process's address space, and the new program is started.
              In this case the program has no per-instance storage
              and is responsible for any further population of its
              address space. 
              <p> To support construction of more complex address spaces,
              there is a means to build a read-only immutable program
              that can then build a more general address space.
              This uses an assembly program that interprets a table of
              invocations to be executed to build the address space. 
              You must define the table to build the space as you want it.
              For details see
              <code>base/lib/constructor/InterpreterTable.h</code>
              and related files.
          </ul>
	  <p>
	    On entry, the new process inherits the key register state
	    that was left by the protospace.
            This will be the default runtime environment defined above.
	  <p>
	    If the new program was linked as a small space,
            it can then create its own stack and data areas
            as described above for crt1. 
            If the new address space was constructed from a VCS,
            its stack and data areas will be filled in as page faults occur.
	  <h2>3. Process Teardown</h2>
	  <p>
	    Just as the process must arrange to initialize itself, it
	    must arrange to destroy itself.  Since the process
	    created its own address space, it must destroy it.
            The challenge of destruction is
	    the <strong>capros_key_destroy</strong> request.
	    Careful look at the object reference manual will show that
	    the <strong>destroy</strong> operation <em>is expected to
	    return</em>.  The question is, "How can a program that no
	    longer has an address space return to anyone?"
            This is the inverse of the bootstrapping problem. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
            The answer is, we rely on the process creator for help.
	    A process that wishes to honor the
	    <strong>OC_Destroy</strong> order code must hang on to
	    its process creator key.  If the process runs in a kept
	    address space, it must also retain access to the
	    protospace address space.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When asked to destroy itself, the process should of course first
	    destroy anything it has explicitly built.
	    Then, how teardown is accomplished depends on the process
	    address space.
          <ul>
          <li> If it was built as a small process by the protospace,
            it must undo that by calling <code>protospace_destroy_small</code>.
            <code>protospace_destroy_small</code> is declared and
            documented in <code>domain/ProtoSpaceDS.h</code>.
          <p> <code>protospace_destroy_small</code> installs the protospace
            address space and goes to an entry point in that space
            known as the <strong>telospace</strong>.
            (Greek root <em>telo-</em> is the opposite of <em>proto-</em>.)
            That code returns to the space bank any pages in the old
            address space that were created, returns the GPT to the bank,
            and then invokes the <code>destroyCallerAndReturn</code>
            method on the process creator.
	  <li>
            <p>If the process's address space was built from a VCS,
            it can call <code>protospace_destroy</code>.
            However, there is a note that that procedure is obsolete. 
            This may not be working currently. 
          <li>
            If the address space was a more complex space built using
            the interpreter facility, a corresponding facility will
            tear down the space. See <code>InterpreterDestroy</code>,
            which is declared and documented in
            <code>base/lib/constructor/InterpreterTable.h</code>.
          </ul>
	  <p>
            Note that all this is initiated by the program
            (usually in response to a destroy request), which means
            it happens before <code>main()</code> returns.
            Since <code>main()</code> never returns,
            static destructors and <code>atexit()</code> procedures
            are never called. These facilities are not supported.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Note that protospace itself is a shared resource that does
	    <em>not</em> get destroyed, as is the interpreter table.
