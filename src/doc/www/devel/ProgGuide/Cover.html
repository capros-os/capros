	    This document collects information on a number of topics
	    of interest to the EROS programmer, ranging from an
	    introduction to programming under EROS to a description of
	    the EROS runtime environments and core services.  Used in
	    conjunction with the <a href="../ObRef/Cover.html">EROS
	    Object Reference</a>, it should provide enough information
	    to write programs for the EROS system.
	  </p>
	  <br clear=left>
	  <p>
	    While the object reference is starting to look fairly
	    stable, this document remains more preliminary.  We are
	    still learning how best to describe the EROS system, and
	    are constantly adding information for internal use.  We
	    are putting this document on the Web in spite of its
	    preliminary state for several reasons.  A number of people
	    have wanted to get a sense of what the EROS system
	    provides.  Our working group needs the document, and the
	    Web provides a convenient way to make it available.
	    Writing the document helps ensure that the implementation
	    is solid. Our usual practice is to write the appropriate
	    chunk of the reference document before implementing the
	    object itself.
