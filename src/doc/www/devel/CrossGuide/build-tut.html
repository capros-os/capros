      <p>
        When a CapROS system is 
        <a href="Boot.html">booted</a>,
        the kernel image and system image are loaded.
        This document describes the system image:
        what it contains and how it is constructed.
        Note, a "system image" is <em>not</em> the same as
        the file produced by <a href="mkimage-ref.html">mkimage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A system image consists of either:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        one <em>preload image</em> containing all the non-persistent objects, or
      <li>
        two contigous preload images,
        the first containing all the non-persistent objects,
        and the second containing all the initial persistent objects
        of a big bang. This form is used when a big bang is being set up
        by preloading the persistent objects into RAM.
      </ul>
      <h1>Preload Image</h1>
      <p>
        A <em>preload image</em> defines a contiguous range of OIDs,
        and a set of objects in that range to be preloaded.
        The range of OIDs is divided into five consecutive regions:
        nodes, nonzero pages, zero pages, submaps, and unallocated frames.
        These regions are described in detail below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first frame of a preload image contains only a structure
        called NPObjectsDescriptor
        that defines the starting OID and information about the OID regions.
        It also tells whether there are one or two preload images,
        and it defines the OID of the IPL process,
        the one non-persistent process to be run at boot time.
        This structure is defined in the file sys/disk/NPODescr.h.
      </p>
      <p>
        A preload image is produced by running
        <a href="npgen-ref.html">npgen</a>,
        which takes a mkimage file as input.
      </p>
      <h2>Node Frames</h2>
      <p>
        Nodes that were allocated in the mkimage file
        are grouped into node frames and placed in the preload image
        following the first frame (the one containing the 
        NPObjectsDescriptor structure).
        They are assigned OIDs from the first OID of the range.
      </p>
      <h2>Nonzero Page Frames</h2>
      <p>
        Nonzero pages that were allocated in the mkimage file
        are placed in the preload image following the node frames.
        They are assigned OIDs following the node frames.
      </p>
      <h2>Zero Page Frames</h2>
      <p>
        Zero pages that were allocated in the mkimage file
        are assigned OIDs following the nonzero page frames.
        They are not stored in the preload image.
      </p>
      <h2>Submap Frames</h2>
      <p>
        Each preload image can have one prime spacebank that allocates
        the objects in the corresponding OID range.
        Allocating space requires a bit map, which itself takes space.
        To manage this recursive problem, the spacebank calculates the
        amount of space that it will require, and reserves
        this region of OIDs for that space.
      </p>
      <h2>Unallocated Frames</h2>
      <p>
        All the remaining frames in the OID range are unallocated
        and are not stored in the preload image.
      </p>
      <h1>Special Objects</h1>
      <p>
         Mkimage recognizes two objects for special purposes.
      </p>
      <h2>Volsize Node</h2>
      <p>
        This node is called volsize for historical reasons.
        The following slots of volsize are used.
        These slots are described in more detail
        in the file sys/disk/NPODescr.h.
      </p>
      <h3>Slots 0 and 1</h3>
      <p>
        These slots hold a number cap containing the number of
        nodes and pages, respectively, allocated by mkimage in this range.
        If additional object types are defined,
        slots after 1 will be used for them.
      </p>
      <h3>Slot volsize_range</h3>
      <p>
        This slot holds a Range capability for the range of OIDs
        described by this preload image.
        The spacebank uses this to determine the number of frames in the range.
      </p>
      <h3>Slot volsize_thread</h3>
      <p>
        In the persistent volsize node,
        this slot contains a node capability to the persistent threadlist node,
        described below.
      </p>
      <h3>Slot volsize_nplinkCap</h3>
      <p>
        In the persistent volsize node,
        this slot contains a start capability to the nplink process,
        which receives non-persistent caps at boot time.
      </p>
      <h3>Slot volsize_pvolsize</h3>
      <p>
        In the non-persistent volsize node,
        this slot contains a node capability to 
        the persistent volsize node.
        This allows the non-persistent world to access the persistent world,
        in particular the nplink process.
        The persistent volsize node has a fixed well-known OID.
      </p>
      <h2>Threadlist Node</h2>
      <p>
        This node is the root of the "threadlist", the list of processes
        in this OID range to be run.
      </p>
      <h1>CapROS Volume Structure</h1>
      <p>This probably belongs elsewhere.</p>
      <P> A CapROS volume is a logical disk.  On an EROS-formatted floppy,
      the volume spans the entire disk.  On hard disks things are a bit more
      complicated.  Typically, the system firmware is designed to allow
      multiple independent operating systems to be loaded onto a single
      disk.  The disk is divided into non-overlapping regions, typically
      called <STRONG>partitions</STRONG>, and each operating system acts for
      the most part as if its partition was a single disk.  CapROS is no
      different; it views its partition as a single volume, and largely
      ignores the rest of the disk.
      <P> Every CapROS volume has up to 64 non-overlapping areas.  To avoid
      collision with firmware terminology, we use the term
      <STRONG>division</STRONG>.  Divisions come in several types:
      <ul>
	<table>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Unused
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      Empty. Placeholder for unallocated space.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Boot
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      Contains the system-dependent boot code.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      DivTbl
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      A table describing the division layout.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Kernel
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      The kernel's code.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Spare
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      Division containing spare sectors.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Log
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      A swap area.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      Object
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      Holds CapROS Pages and Nodes.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </ul>
      <P> Every volume has exactly one boot division at sector 0.  Every
      volume has <EM>at most one</EM> kernel division.
      <P> Every disk technology that we know about reserves sector 0 of a
      partition as the "boot sector."  The CapROS boot sector is defined by the
      VolHdr structure. It contains the following, among other things:
      <ul>
        <li>A unique system identifier (iplSysId). All the volumes
        in a single CapROS system
        will have the same system identifier.
        If the computer has volumes for more than one independent CapROS system,
        the iplSysId distinguishes them. Only volumes matching the iplSysId
        of the booted volume will be mounted.
        <li>The location of the primary (and optional secondary) division
        tables.
      </ul>
      <P> The division table describes, for each division, the type, the
      starting sector, and the ending sector.
      If the division is an Object or Log division, the division table
      also contains the starting OID or SwapLoc of the division.
