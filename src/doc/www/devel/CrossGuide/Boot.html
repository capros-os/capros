    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Booting a CapROS system involves the following steps, each of which
      is discussed in detail below.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>The kernel and preloaded objects are loaded into RAM.
    <li>The kernel runs and initializes itself.
    <li>The kernel runs the nonpersistent IPL process, which in turn starts the
      other initially running nonpersistent processes.
    <li>The kernel executes the restart sequence, which initializes
      the persistent objects.
    </ol>
    <h1>Loading the kernel and preloaded objects</h1>
    <p>
      A CapROS system consists of the kernel and objects. 
      Preloaded objects are those that are loaded at the same time
      as the kernel. 
      Non-preloaded objects are loaded from disk by the CapROS pager.
      Preloaded objects include all nonpersistent objects,
      and may include the persistent objects that define a big bang.
      The <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/build-tut.html">build tutorial</a>
      has more information on the big bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kernel and preloaded objects are loaded by a boot loader
      from some nonvolatile medium. The details are machine-specific.
      Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      On the PC, we use <a href="Multiboot.html">GRUB</a>
      to load a system image containing the kernel and preloaded objects.
      The kernel is Multiboot compliant. 
      See the <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/build-tut.html">build tutorial</a>
      for details of building the system image. 
      For development, we use NFS to copy the system image from the
      development system to the test system,
      temporarily running Linux on the test system.
      See the <a href="../project/build.html">build instructions</a>
      for details.
    <li>
      On the ARM, for development we use Redboot to load the kernel code,
      the kernel data, and the preloaded objects. Redboot receives
      these files from the development system over Ethernet.
      See the <a href="../project/build.html">build instructions</a>
      for details.
    <li>
      An embedded system might load a system image from ROM.
    </ul>
    <h1>Kernel initialization</h1>
    <p>
      Kernel initialization is not yet documented.
    </p>
    <h1>IPL process</h1>
    <p>
      The kernel starts the system by running the single nonpersistent
      IPL process. The IPL process is identified by an OID that is defined
      in the system image, using the
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/mkimage-ref.html">mkimage</a>
      "ipl" directive. 
      The IPL process goes through a list of nonpersistent processes
      to be started, and starts them. 
      This list is built using the mkimage "run" and "threadlist" directives.
      In a fully nonpersistent system, this list of processes includes all the
      initial processes, such as device drivers.
    </p>
    <h2>Big Bang Theory</h2>
    <p>
      In a persistent system, the initial state of the persistent objects
      must be defined using mkimage and then set up in the system.
      There are two ways to do this.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/sysgen-ref.html">Sysgen</a>
      takes a file produced by mkimage and writes it to a disk volume
      so the objects can be loaded from the disk
      as though they were checkpointed there.
      During development, this method requires moving the initialized volume
      from the development system to the test system.
    <li>
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/npgen-ref.html">Npgen</a>
      takes a file produced by mkimage and includes those objects
      in the preloaded objects of a system image. 
      These preloaded persistent objects will then be saved to disk
      on the first checkpoint.
      This method limits the big bang objects to what will fit in RAM,
      but it is more convenient for development.
    </ul>
    <h1>Restart Sequence</h1>
    <p>
      There are several different scenarios for the restart sequence. 
    <ul>
    <li><h2>Big Bang from Preloaded Objects</h2>
      <p>
        In this scenario, the initial (big bang) persistent objects
        are preloaded into RAM.
        The system image of the persistent objects should contain an
        IPL process. The IPL process is started in the restart sequence,
        and it in turn starts the other persistent processes.
        If there is any checkpoint on disk, it is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build such a system, npgen is run twice, once to create an
        image file of the nonpersistent objects, and once to create an
        image file of the persistent objects.
        When building the nonpersistent objects, the -p option must be
        given to npgen.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the system is initialized and running, it can be checkpointed
        to disk. Note that it takes at least two checkpoints to overwrite
        any old checkpoint that may already be on the disk. 
      </p>
    <li><h2>Restart from Disk</h2>
      <p>
        If there are no preloaded persistent objects, but there is
        a disk with a checkpoint, the restart sequence loads the state of
        the persistent world from the checkpoint.
        See the <a href="../../design-notes/Checkpoint.html">
        Checkpoint Mechanism</a> for details. 
        The checkpoint on disk may be either the previous state of the
        system saved by a checkpoint, or a big bang (including an IPL process)
        written to disk by sysgen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When building the nonpersistent objects, the -p option must be
        given to npgen so the nonpersistent world can find the
        persistent world. 
      </p>
    <li><h2>Nonpersistent system</h2>
      <p>
        If there are no preloaded persistent objects and no disk
        with a checkpoint, the system runs without any persistent objects;
        it is nonpersistent only. 
        In this case the -p option must <em>not</em> be given to npgen.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As an implementation detail, the restart sequence is driven by
      a kernel process.
