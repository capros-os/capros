    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Booting a CapROS system involves the following steps, each of which
      is discussed in detail below.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>The kernel and preloaded objects are loaded into RAM.
    <li>The kernel runs and initializes itself.
    <li>The kernel runs the IPL process, which in turn starts the
      initially running non-persistent processes.
    <li>In a persistent system, one of the non-persistent processes
      restarts the persistent processes from the last checkpoint or big bang.
    </ol>
    <h1>Loading the kernel and preloaded objects</h1>
    <p>
      A CapROS system consists of the kernel and objects. 
      Preloaded objects are those that are loaded at the same time
      as the kernel. 
      Non-preloaded objects are loaded from disk by the CapROS pager.
      Preloaded objects include all non-persistent objects,
      and may include the persistent objects that define a big bang.
      The <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/build-tut.html">build tutorial</a>
      has more information on the big bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kernel and preloaded objects are loaded by a boot loader
      from some nonvolatile medium. The details are machine-specific.
      Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      On the PC, we use <a href="Multiboot.html">GRUB</a>
      to load a system image containing the kernel and preloaded objects.
      The kernel is Multiboot compliant. 
      See the <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/build-tut.html">build tutorial</a>
      for details of building the system image. 
      For development, we use NFS to copy the system image from the
      development system to the test system,
      temporarily running Linux on the test system.
      See the <a href="../project/build.html">build instructions</a>
      for details.
    <li>
      On the ARM, for development we use Redboot to load the kernel code,
      the kernel data, and the preloaded objects. Redboot receives
      these files from the development system over Ethernet.
      See the <a href="../project/build.html">build instructions</a>
      for details.
    <li>
      An embedded system might load a system image from ROM.
    </ul>
    <h1>Kernel initialization</h1>
    <p>
      Kernel initialization will be documented later.
    </p>
    <h1>IPL process</h1>
    <p>
      The kernel starts the system by running the single nonpersistent
      IPL process. The IPL process is identified by an OID that is defined
      in the system image, using the
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/mkimage-ref.html">mkimage</a>
      "ipl" directive. 
      The IPL process goes through a list of nonpersistent processes
      to be started, and starts them. 
      This list is built using the mkimage "run" and "threadlist" directives.
      In a fully nonpersistent system, this list of processes includes all the
      initial processes, such as device drivers.
    </p>
    <h2>Big Bang Theory</h2>
    <p>
      In a persistent system, the initial state of the persistent objects
      must be defined using mkimage and then set up in the system.
      There are two ways to do this.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/sysgen-ref.html">Sysgen</a>
      takes a file produced by mkimage and writes it to a disk volume
      so the objects can be loaded from the disk
      as though they were checkpointed there.
      During development, this method requires moving the initialized volume
      from the development system to the test system.
    <li>
      <a href="../devel/CrossGuide/npgen-ref.html">Npgen</a>
      takes a file produced by mkimage and includes those objects
      in the preloaded objects of a system image. 
      These preloaded persistent objects will then be saved to disk
      on the first checkpoint.
      This method limits the big bang objects to what will fit in RAM,
      but it is more convenient for development.
    </ul>
    <h1>Restart from checkpoint</h1>
    <p>
      In a persistent system that is restarting from a checkpoint,
      or that is performing a big bang using the method that loads
      the initial objects from disk,
      a nonpersistent process loads the persistent objects and state.
      This may be the IPL process, or another process
      (the latter is more easily configured).
    </p>
    <p>
      CapROS disk volumes (partitions) are identified with an IPLSysId
      that is unique for each system.
      This allows one CapROS system to format disks for another CapROS system
      without confusing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restart process finds
      the configured disks, using a combination of
      configuration data and probing. 
      It mounts all divisions of all volumes with the correct IPLSysId.
      Then it reads the checkpoint headers and loads and starts
      the running persistent processes. 
      This will be documented in detail later.
