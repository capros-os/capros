      <h2>Name</h2>
      <p><b>mkvol</b> -- make new CapROS volume</p>
      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p><b>mkvol</b> [-b bootstrap_image] [-k kernel_image] volmap volume</p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> The <b>mkvol</b> creates a new CapROS volume and formats the
      divisions on that volume.  It optionally places a bootstrap
      image and kernel image on that volume at format time.  Either
      can be altered with the <a
      href="setvol-ref.html"><em>setvol</em></a> utility at a later
      time.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <b>volume</b> can be, for example, a partition on a hard disk,
      a floppy disk,
      or a normal file that is later copied to a partition or disk. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Most of the input to <b>mkvol</b> comes from the <b>volmap</b>
      file, which describes the layout of the volume to be created.
      Entries in the <b>volmap</b> file appear one per line.  All
      characters on a line following a '#' character are treated as
      comments.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each line in the <b>volmap</b> file describes a division to be
      added to the volume, or an attribute to be set in the volume
      header.  A single volume may contain up to 64 divisions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Spare divisions are not used by CapROS,
      because both (E)IDE and SCSI drive technologies provide
      automatic sector remapping.
      </p>
      <dl>
	<dt><b>kernel</b> size OID=oid
	</dt>
	<dd>
	     <p>
	     Add a kernel division to the volume, where <b>size</b> is
	     the length of the division in pages. <b>oid</b> is the
	     starting object identifier for the division,
             which will be used for later update from within CapROS.
             At most one kernel division can be present per volume.
             <p>By convention, the kernel devision OID is 0xFFFF00000000,
             and all OIDs in the range 0FFFF00000000 through
             0xFFFFFFFFFFFF are reserved for future use by the implementation.
	     </p>
	</dd>
	<dt><b>object</b> size OID=oid
	</dt>
	<dd>
	     <p>
	     Add a division that will contain objects, where
	     <b>size</b> is the length of the division in pages and
	     <b>oid</b> is the starting object identifier for this
	     division.  The division will be initialized to contain as
	     many zero-filled Pages as the division will hold, and the
	     zero attribute is set for these pages in the associated
	     allocation pots.  All on-disk pages will actually be
	     zeroed to improve compression.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	     If multiple object divisions are added, their <b>oid</b>
	     numbering need not be consecutive.
	     Object divisions can be replicated.
	     </p>
	</dd>
	<dt><b>cklog</b> size LID=logloc
	</dt>
	<dd>
	     <p>
	     Add a division for use in checkpointing, where that will
	     contain objects, where <b>size</b> is the length of the
	     division in pages and <b>logloc</b> is the starting log
	     frame number for this division. All log frames will be
	     zeroed to improve compression.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	     If multiple log divisions are added, their collected log
	     locations must not contain numbering holes.  Log
	     divisions can be replicated.
	     </p>
	</dd>
	<dt><b>divtable</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	     <p>
	     Add a division containing a division table.  The first
	     division table added will be listed in the volume header
	     as the primary division table.  The second added (if any)
	     will be listed as the secondary division table.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	     All division tables are one page
	     </p>
	</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
      There is no provision for explicitly adding a <b>boot</b>
      division.  Because the volume header resides in the boot
      division, the presence of a boot division is not optional.
      The first division is always the boot division.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second division is always the DivisionTable division. 
      </p>
      <p>
      There is no provision for specifying the name of the bootstrap
      image file within the <b>volmap</b> file, because the approprite
      binary for the bootstrap image is media-dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
      A random, hopefully unique, iplSysId is written. There is no provision
      for specifying the iplSysId. If you want to format a disk to add
      to an existing system, use 
      <a href="lsvol-ref.html"><b>lsvol</b></a> on the existing boot volume
      to determine the desired iplSysId,
      use <b>mkvol</b> to format the new disk, and then use
      <a href="setvol-ref.html"><b>setvol</b></a> to set the iplSysId
      of the new disk.
