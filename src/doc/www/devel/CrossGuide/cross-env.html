      <P> This document describes the programs used to generate an initial
      bootable EROS environment.  It provides a brief description of the
      cross environment and system generation tools.

      EROS currently builds on Intel-based machines running Linux.
      </p>
      <h2>1.1. Hardware</h2>
      <p>
      With patience, the current system builds on a 75Mhz 486 portable
      with 8 megabytes of memory, though we were surely happier after
      upgrading the memory to 20 megabytes.
      </p>
      <p>
      A 120 Mhz (or better) Pentium (or better) chip is recommended.
      Compatible chips are untested, but should <em>build</em> the
      system without difficulty.  We have had no opportunity to test
      EROS itself on the Cyrix or AMD parts, and look forward to your
      feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
      We currently build on systems with as little as 16 megabytes of
      main memory.  32 megabytes cuts the time required to complete
      the build nearly in half.  64 megabytes makes it possible to do
      other things (such as run emacs) without unduly slowing the
      build.  We have seen no appreciable benefit past 64 megabytes.
      At that point, it would seem that you are better off going for a
      faster chip.
      </p>
      <p>
      EROS itself presently supports only (E)IDE drives.  The driver
      should in theory also support older drives, but this is
      untested.  While we will adopt reasonable patches for supporting
      older drives, we will not put engineering effort into supporting
      them.  SCSI support is planned.
      </p>
      <h2>1.2. Operating System</h2>
      <p>
      The EROS build environment is currently designed to run on Linux
      systems.  Compatibility with various Linux releases is
      summarized below.  Additions to this list are welcome, and
      should be sent to the <a
      href="mailto:eros-doc@eros-os.org"><tt>eros-doc</tt></a>
      alias.

      While we have not tried to do so, it should not be
      difficult to make this build environment operate from any UNIX
      derivative using ELF-based object files and GNU make.
      </p>
      <p>
      The development group is currently using the RedHat 4.2 and 5.0
      releases.  If you are running an earlier release of RedHat, it
      is very much worth upgrading for the sake of improved UNIX
      security.
      </p>
      <p>
      With some work the a.out file format could be accomodated, which
      would facilitate development from FreeBSD or NetBSD.  It would
      be very difficult to facilitate building from Microsoft operating
      systems, and we have no plans to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our recommendation, if your circumstances permit it, is to work
      from Linux, as a rehosted Linux environment will eventually be
      distributed for the EROS system.
      </p>
      <H1>2. The Distribution</H1>
      <p>
      The EROS distribution will be available as a gzipped tar image
      from the <a href="http://www.eros-os.org">EROS Home
      Page</a>.  <h2>2.1. Space Requirements</h2>
      <p>
      To build the release, you will need approximately:

	</table>
      </center>
      <p>
      If necessary, the documentation source tree (<tt>eros/src/doc</tt> can
      be deleted before building, reducing the overall space
      requirements to 15.7 megabytes.
      </p>
      <h2>2.2. Build Tree Organization</h2>
      <p>
      The top level of the build tree is the <tt>eros/</tt>
      directory.  This directory may be placed anywhere that is
      convenient.  All makefiles in the build tree locate this
      directory by referencing the variable <tt>EROS_ROOT</tt>.  In my
      own case, the build tree sits in my home directory, and the
      <tt>EROS_ROOT</tt> variable is set to
      <tt>"/home/shap/eros"</tt>.
      <p>
      Once built, the next level down in the tree contains several
      further directories:

      The documentation tree can be navigated through your web
      browser.  <em>Some browsers do not work correctly unless the
      document is compacted</em>.  We therefore recommend that you
      install and navigate the <tt>eros/doc/www</tt> tree, and substitute
      <tt>eros/<u><b>src</b></u>/doc/www</tt> when you need to locate the
      corresponding source file.
      </p>

      The base tree is organized as follows:

      <p>
      In most of the source tree, the build occurs directly in the
      relevant directory.  In the kernel subtree, the build occurs in
      <tt>sys/arch/XXX/build/</tt>, where <tt>XXX</tt> varies
      according to the architecture name.
      </p>
      <p>
      Other packages, including a port of XFree86 and a Linux
      rehosting project, are currently underway.  Each of these
      packages has an associated directory under <tt>eros/src</tt>,
      and has its own conventions for build tree structure.  All of
      these packages depend on a successfully built base package.
      </p>
      <h1>3. Environment Setup</h1>
      <p>
      Before building the EROS distribution, two environment variables
      must be set:
      </p>
      <center>
	<table width=85%>
	  <tr>
	    <th valign=top align=left>Variable</th>
	    <th valign=top align=left>Description</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>EROS_ROOT</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top>Identifies the top of the EROS tree.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>EROS_TARGET</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top>Indicates the target architecture to be
	      build.  The only valid value at this time is
	      <tt>i486</tt>.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top><tt>EROS_CONFIG</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top>Identifies the kernel configuration that
	      you wish to use.  If this variable is not set, it will
	      default to 'DEFAULT' in most of the build tree.  This
	      name should be the name of a file in
	      <tt>eros/src/base/sys/arch/$(EROS_TARGET)/conf</tt>.  By
	      convention, all platforms provide a <tt>DEFAULT</tt>
	      configuration.  Other plausible configurations include
	      <tt>DEVEL</tt>, which includes kernel debugger and
	      assertion checking, and <tt>DDB</tt>, which includes the
	      kernel debugger, but <em>without</em> assertion checks.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>
      <p>
      At some point, this list will be expanded to include an
      environment variable describing the host environment for the
      build.  At present, builds from non-i386 versions of Linux are
      not supported by the build environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my own build environment, the <tt>eros/</tt> directory sits
      under my home directory.  For Bourne shell and <tt>bash</tt>
      users, your login-time initialization file should contain:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt>EROS_ROOT="${HOME}/eros"</tt>
	<br> <tt>EROS_TARGET=i486</tt>
	<br> <tt>EROS_CONFIG=DEFAULT</tt>
	<br> <tt>export EROS_TARGET EROS_ROOT EROS_CONFIG</tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Users of <tt>csh</tt> or <tt>tcsh</tt> should instead use:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt>setenv EROS_ROOT $HOME/eros</tt>
	<br> <tt>setenv EROS_TARGET i486</tt>
	<br> <tt>setenv EROS_CONFIG DEFAULT</tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I have found it useful <em>not</em> to set the
      <tt>EROS_ROOT</tt> variable in my <tt>.cshrc</tt> or
      <tt>.bashrc</tt> or equivalent.  Once in a while I want to
      maintain two build trees, and this is rendered impossible if the
      per-shell configuration file overrides the value of
      <tt>EROS_ROOT</tt>.
      Removing this value from the per-shell configuration file,
      however, leads to two problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li> <p>
	     Under the default configuration, the variable will not be
	     correctly inherited by an <tt>emacs</tt> session invoked
	     directly from a window manager menu.
	     </p>
	</li>
	<li> <p>
	     <tt>rsh</tt>/<tt>ssh</tt> can no longer be used to
	     perform remote builds unless the login file or it's
	     equivalent is ``sourced.''
	     </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The first problem can be solved by making a small repair to your
      <tt>.xsession</tt> file.  If you do not have one, it may be
      necessary to copy <tt>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession</tt> to
      <tt>$HOME/.xsession</tt> so you can apply this fix.
      </p>
      <p>
      Change the first line, which reads
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt>#!/bin/bash</tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      To read:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt>#!/bin/bash -login</tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This will cause your .login file to be read before the window
      manager is started, after which all of your <tt>.login</tt>
      environment variables will be inherited correctly by
      applications started from the window manager.  The fact that the
      default <tt>.xsession</tt> file does not do this is a
      <em>bug</em>
      </p>
      <p>
      An alternative workaround is to have your <tt>.cshrc</tt> or
      <tt>.bashrc</tt> only set <tt>EROS_ROOT</tt> if it is not set
      already.  This also solves the <tt>rsh</tt>/<tt>srsh</tt>
      problem.
      </p>
      <p>
      Both workarounds can safely be applied simultaneously.
      </p>
      <h1>3. Building the Distribution</h1>
      <p>
      At this point, you can build the distribution.  To do so:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt> cd $EROS_ROOT/src </tt>
	<br> <tt> make -k install </tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you choose to rebuild the tree you may find some other make
      targets useful:
      </p>
      <center>
	<table width=85%>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top nowrap>
	      <tt>make clean</tt></td>
	      <td valign=top>
		Recursively removes all object files.
	      </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top nowrap>
	      <tt>make -k clobber</tt></td>
	      <td valign=top>
		Recursively removes all object files, binaries,
		libraries, and links within the build tree.
	      </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top nowrap><tt>make nodepend</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top>
	      Removes the dependency files which were automatically
	      generated by previous build(s).
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign=top nowrap><tt>make -k clobber nodepend</tt></td>
	    <td valign=top>
	      Restores the build tree to pristine status.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
      </center>
      <h1>4. Generating the Installation Image</h1>
      <p>
      Instructions for producing new EROS images can be found in
      <a href="build-tut.html"><em>Building an EROS Disk
      Image</em></a>.  To build the generic installation image, you
      can now:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt> cd $EROS_ROOT/src/base/sysimage </tt>
	<br> <tt> make -k floppy </tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This command should be issued with a blank floppy in the floppy
      drive, and you must have write permission on the floppy drive.
      If you do not wish to actually write the floppy, you can use:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<tt> cd $EROS_ROOT/src/base/sysimage </tt>
	<br> <tt> make -k sysvol </tt>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This will produce the system volume image, which can be copied
      to a floppy or hard disk partition using the <tt>dd</tt>
      utility.
