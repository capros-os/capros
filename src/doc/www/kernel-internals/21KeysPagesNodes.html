<p> Nearly everything in the EROS system is constructed out of pages
and nodes.  Because of this, we refer to pages and nodes as
<em>primary objects</em>.  EROS uses the majority of the system's
physical memory as a <em>cache</em> of primary objects, and this
chapter describes how that cache is managed.  The chapter covers:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The structure of object keys, and what makes a key valid.
       <p>
  <li> What primary objects look like -- both in memory and on the
       disk,
       <p>
  <li> The data structures that support the primary object cache,
       <p>
  <li> Locating primary objects in the memory cache,
       <p>
  <li> How primary objects are loaded into memory,
       <p>
  <li> How primary objects are removed from memory,
       <p>
  <li> How object authority is rescinded.
</ul>
<p> In addition to describing the object management mechanisms, this
chapter covers many of the important correctness constraints of the
EROS kernel.
<h1>1 Keys</h1>
<p> The most important data structure in EROS is the Key.  Keys come
in several varieties:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Object keys</em> name things that are built out of pages
       and nodes.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Device keys</em> grant access to individual hardware
       devices.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Number keys</em> implement 80-bit numbers.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Miscellaneous keys</em> provide access to
       kernel-implemented objects and services.
</ul>
<p> All keys are the same size.  In the current implementation, the
EROS key format occupies 12 bytes, which allows the system to provide
up to 2<sup>48</sup> distinct pages and 2<sup>48</sup> distinct nodes.  The
current design can therefore manage up to 1,073,741,824
<em>giga</em>bytes of user data.  That number deserves some
perspective.  If you were to take every disk drive ever manufactured
since the start of the computer industry and hook them all to a single
EROS system, you'ld still have plenty of room for more.  On the other
hand, we may well need a larger key format within the next decade.
<p> In this chapter we will be primarily concerned with object keys.
The structure of an on-disk object key is shown in
Figure 21.1.

</ul>
<p> The details of most of the fields will be explored as we proceed
through this chapter.  Interpretation of the <em>authority</em> field
depends on the type of the key, so this field is described in the
discussion of individual key types.
<p> In order for an object to be manipulated, the user must first hold
a key to that object.  Though a number of optimizations are performed
by the kernel, all object accesses conceptually occur by invoking some
key.  Before an object key can be invoked, it must first be
<em>prepared</em>.  Preparing an object key involves the following
steps:
<p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li> The memory cache is checked to see if the object is present in
       memory.  If it is not, an I/O operation is started to bring the
       object in from the disk.  Once the I/O is completed, the
       process will restart the operation, which will cause us to try
       and prepare the key again.
       <p>
  <li> The allocation count of the key is examined to determine if
       this is a valid key.  If not, that is the end of the matter.
       Invoking an invalid key causes the invoking domain to block.
       <p>
  <li> If the key is valid, and the object is in memory, it is
       converted into an optimized, in-memory form.
       <p>
  <li> The key is marked as prepared by setting the 'P' bit to 1.
</ol>
<p> If a key has been successfully prepared, the associated object is
known to be in memory.  The object will remain in memory as long as
there exists a prepared key for it.
<p> The important part of the prepartion process is that it converts
the key into in-memory form, as shown in Figure 21.2.
The in-memory format contains a pointer to the in-memory location of
the object, making repeated searches unnecessary.

<h2>1.1 Locating Objects on the Disk</h2>
<p> The CDA field of the key gives the <em>coded disk address</em> of
the object named by the key.  A CDA is simply a 48-bit number that
uniquely identifies the object.  EROS disks are divided into
contiguous divisions, each of which holds some range of nodes or
pages.  When the system first starts up, it examines all of the
attached disk drives to learn what disk divisions are present.  Each
division has an associated type (node or page), a starting CDA and
some number of objects.  Objects within a division are numbered
sequentially beginning with the starting CDA.
<p> As EROS first examines the disks, it constructs an in-memory
table.  For each division that is present, EROS remembers the type of
the division, the disk on which it appears, the area of the disk that
the division occupies, and the range of CDAs that the division
contains.  When EROS needs to locate an object on the disk, it first
uses this table to determine which disk contains the object, and then
performs some trivial arithmetic to compute where on the disk the
object resides.
<h2>1.2 Locating Objects In Memory</h2>
<p> As execution proceeds, objects are loaded into main memory.  Every
object cached in memory has an associated object header.  For nodes,
this header is directly attached to the object.  For pages, the header
is kept in a parallel structure called the <strong>core table</strong>.  The
object header for an in-memory object contains:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The coded disk address of the object.
       <p>
  <li> A pointer to the next object in the CDA hash chain.
       <p>
  <li> The number of prepared keys that reference this object.
       <p>
  <li> The object's disk allocation count.
       <p>
  <li> The object's core allocation count.
       <p>
  <li> The current interpretation of the object.  Nodes, for example,
       can be viewed as nodes or segments.
       <p>
  <li> The age of the object, which describes how long the object has
       been in memory.
       <p>
  <li> The number of pending I/O operations that are in progress on
       this object.  If an I/O operation is in progress, this field
       will be nonzero.
       <p>
  <li> A pointer to the next object.  Objects can be on a number of
       different singly linked lists, but are never on more than one
       of these lists at a time.  The next object pointer is used for
       all of these lists.
       <p>
  <li> A pointer to related data structures.
       <p>
  <li> A flags byte.
</ul>
<p> The header for an in-memory object is placed in a hash table on
the basis of it's CDA.  When a key needs to be prepared, the CDA is
used to search the hash chain for the associated object.  If the
object
<h2>1.3 Allocation Counts</h2>
<p> Every object on the disk has an associated <em>allocation
count</em>.  If the allocation count of the object and the allocation
count of the key do not match, the key is invalid, and conveys no
authority over any object.
