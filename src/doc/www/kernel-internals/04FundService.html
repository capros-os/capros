<p> As was mentioned in <a href="02KernLook.html">Chapter 2</a>, many EROS
system services are implemented as domains.  This chapter presents a
brief overview of some of the more important examples.
<h1>1 The Space Bank</h1>
<p> The space bank maintains a list of which nodes and pages on the
disk have been allocated and which are available.  When a new disk is
added to the system, range keys for the newly created ranges are
provided to the space bank so that space from the disk can be
allocated.
<p> Whenever a domain needs a new page or node, it asks a space bank
to provide one.  When a space bank hands out a node or page to a
requesting domain, all previous keys to that object are <em>
rescinded</em>, ensuring that the requesting domain is the only domain
with authority on that page or node.
<p> One of the questions that is frequently asked about EROS is how
pages and nodes are reclaimed by the system when they are no longer in
user.  Usually, the real question being asked is: how is garbage
collection performed in this system.  The short answer is: it isn't.
The philosophical view is that if you purchase a node or page from a
space bank and manage to lose your key to it, that's your problem.
<p> In practice, it is quite common for domains to wish to allocate a
number of pages and nodes that will be deallocated as a group.  For
example, all of the pages and nodes that make up a temporary storage
segment can be discarded together when the segment is destroyed.  To
support this, a holder of a space bank key can ask for a
<strong>subspace bank</strong>.  All of the objects allocated under a
particular subspace bank are remembered.  When the subspace bank is
destroyed, all of the objects allocated through that bank are
rescinded as a group.
<h1>2 The Domain Creator</h1>
<p> The domain creator is a program the constructs domains.  The
caller hands the domain creator a space bank key, and a description of
the domain to be constructed, and the domain creator returns a domain
key to a newly crafted domain.
<p> In practice, it is quite rare for users to invoke a domain creator
directly.  More commonly, an escrow agent invokes the domain creator
on behalf of the user.
<h1>3 Escrow Agents</h1>
<p> Escrow agents are one of the unusual features of the EROS system.
One of the objectives of EROS is to support mutually adversarial users
who need to collaborate.  A problem that arises in this circumstance
is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> User $A$ has a proprietary algorithm.  They are unwilling to
       disclose even the binary code for this algorithm.
       Equivalently, they may have a public algorithm that makes use
       of proprietary supporting information.
       <p>
  <li> User $B$ wishes to run user $A$'s proprietary algorithm, but is
       unwiling to disclose the data to user $A$.
</ul>
<p> The escrow agent provides a guarantee to both parties.  It
certifies to $B$ that $A$ is unable to obtain $B$'s data, and
simultaneously certifies to $A$ that $B$ is unable to see $A$'s
algorithm.
<p> This approach to security problems is notably different from the
conventional NCSC security categories (the so-called ``orange book''
ratings).  Where the NCSC ratings are concerned with completely
preventing disclosure across trust boundaries, the EROS system is
designed to facilitate selective, controlled disclosure.  This is more
in keeping with the needs of commercial and academic users.
<p> EROS is also capable of enforcing the strictest NCSC
classifications when running on suitable hardware.
<h1>4 The Virtual Copy Agent</h1>
<p> The virtual copy agent implements copy-on-write services.  Given a
segment, the virtual copy agent efficiently creates an initially
read-only copy of the segment, and installs itself as the segment
keeper for the new segment.  As write accesses occur to the new
segment, the virtual copy agent copies the pages from the old segment
into the new one, granting read-write access to the newly copied page.
<h1>5 The Address Space Keeper</h1>
<p> Certain programming conventions have proven to be useful and
general enough that EROS provides a standard segment keeper to support
address spaces.  Domains that locate their data and heap areas at the
conventional locations can use the system-provided address space
keeper to grow those regions on demand.
<p> It should be mentioned here that use of the address space keeper
by native EROS domains is quite rare.  EROS domains tend to be
designed on the philosophy that their total resource usage should be
well understood, and that exceeding these expectations is indicative
of a program failure.  Native-written domains therefore tend to
allocate the full stack and heap spaces in advance, and as a result do
not require an address space keeper.
<h1>6 The Disk Formatter</h1>
<p> The disk formatter domain is used to prepare a disk volume for use
by the EROS kernel.  Given a disk volume, the formatter divides the
volume into ranges of pages and nodes, performs a surface scan of the
volume, and then mounts the volume for use by the EROS system.
<h1>7 The Login Agent</h1>
<p> The login agent is the initial access point to the EROS system.
While the system is internally secure, human beings tend to want to
have identifying names.  The login agent performs login and password
authentication, and informs the session manager that a user has
started a new session.  Depending on the user, the session manager
will then offer a choice of operating environments to the user.
<p> In principle, EROS can support a number of independent login
policies on different terminal lines.  For example, a Kerberos agent
might be prepared to accept kerberos server based authentication in
lieu of a password.  This is an area that we intend to explore
further.  The important point to note for now is that the
authentication service is encapsulated and replaceable, and multiple
authentication services can be supported simultaneously.
<h1>8 The Wait Manager</h1>
<p> The wait manager implements kernel timer multiplexing.  The EROS
kernel implements a small number of high-performance timers, one of
which is held by the wait manager.  The wait manager uses this timer
to perform multiplexed sleep and wakeup services for any programs that
need them.
