<h1>Before you go on...</h1>
<p> <img align=left src="../img/caution.gif"> The kernel
internals document is a work that is actively in progress.  As we
modify the design of various parts of the system, this document will
be updated to reflect the current design.  In order to reduce the
amount of rereading you need to do when the document changes, we've
tried to identify each section with one of the following icons:
<p> 
<center>
  <table width=90%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <th align=left>
	Marking
      </th> 
      <th align=left>
	Meaning
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<img src="../img/cdrom.gif">
      </td>
      <td>
	This portion of a document is frozen (documents on CD-ROM
	cannot be altered).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<img src="../img/atom.gif">
      </td>
      <td>
	This portion of a document is stable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<img src="../img/construction.gif">
      </td>
      <td>
	This portion of the document is still under construction.
	Such sections represent information whose general direction we
	think is sound, but which may require reworking as we do
	the implementation.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<img src="../img/new.gif">
      </td>
      <td>
	This portion of the document reflects tentative new content,
	and should be viewed as ideas we are not committed to.
	Placing them in the document provides a way to capture the
	design process and to solicit your feedback.
