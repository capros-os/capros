<p> This chapter provides a high-level view of the EROS system as seen
by a programmer.  It does not attempt to be exhaustive; that will come
later.  The purpose of this chapter is to give you a feel for the
system before proceeding on to the details.
<p> EROS is very different from systems like UNIX(tm) or Microsoft
Windows(tm).  Newcomers who are familiar with these systems find EROS
frustrating at first, because it violates their expectations of how an
operating system <em>should</em> work.  We encourage you to try to set
aside what you know for the moment and approach EROS as a clean slate.
<h1>1 EROS Applications</h1>
<p> In conventional operating systems, applications are usually built
as a single large process.  Typically, the process will use a number
of shared libraries, but a single program may be made up of hundreds
of thousands of lines of code.  This style, which we refer to as
<em>monolithic</em> programming, is necessary because processes are
ephemeral.  If the machine is shut down, or unexpectedly halts, all
processes are lost.  Recreating an application that is broken into
many processes is complex, so usually the application is written as a
single large program.
<p> The monolithic programming approach suffers from several problems:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Fault Isolation</em> - In a large program, it can be quite
       difficult to find the source of a runtime error.  Often, the
       fault manifests itself in a module completely unrelated to the
       source of the problem.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Security</em> - In a non-persistent system, it is difficult
       to authorize a user to run a program without authorizing them
       to read the program code.  If the code is proprietary, this is
       a problem.
       <p>
  <li> <em>OS Complexity</em> - The need to reconstruct processes from
       some other source is how the whole notion of file systems came
       into being.  This tends to force the operating system to
       support a file system and/or some kind of human-readable naming
       conventions.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Adaptability</em> - Making a change to a large program is
       costly.  The entire program must be recompiled and retested,
       which takes an amazing amount of time.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Specification Failure</em> - Because there are no enforced
       boundaries and interfaces between components, there is a
       tendancy for the code to drift away from the specification.
       Similarly, testing conformance is difficult.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Authority Confusion</em> - Because a program's authorities
       must be reconstructed every time the program is executed, ad
       hoc security schemes are necessary.  The UNIX superuser bit and
       the Win32 registry are examples of ad hoc security mechanisms.
</ul>
<p> The fault isolation problem is greatly reduced, and the other
issues eliminated, if running programs are preserved across system
shutdowns.  All objects in EROS, including processes, are
<em>persistent</em>.  Periodically, the EROS system saves a consistent
copy of the entire machine state to disk.  If power is interrupted,
the system restarts from the most recently saved system image.
<p> Persistent processes enable a whole new aproach to application
design.  Instead of building shared libraries, common services in EROS
are placed in seperate, persistent domains.  Because domains are
persistent, there is no need to recreate them each time an application
is started, which would be necessary in a non-persistent system.
<p> Applications in EROS are typically constructed out of several
independent processes, which we call <strong>domains</strong>.  Each
domain performs a specific, well-defined function.  Each domain
carries exactly the authority that it requires to perform its
function, and no more.  Domains can have independent exception
handling policies and recovery mechanisms.
<p> While it is common to build several domains for a single
application, the EROS system comes with a toolkit of useful domains.
Some of these provide high-level facilities such as sorting and data
management.  Others implement various supporting policies for such
things as page fault handling.  Typically, an application designer
will make use of several ``off the shelf'' domains in constructing an
application.
<p> These domains are more than just libraries.  In addition to code
and data, each of these domains has the ability to remember
information from one session to the next, and runs in it's own
protected environment.  Services implemented using domains can run in
parallel with the application they serve.  We refer to such protected,
independent services as <em>active persistent agents</em>.  They are
one of the keys to EROS's reliability.
<p> Placing common services in seperate domains has several
advantages:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The service runs in its own address space.  If it does fail the
       remainder of the program is unaffected, and the guilty portion
       of the system is easily identified.
       <p>
  <li> The service can be tested independently, because it's interface
       is well defined and it's interaction with the rest of the
       system is well understood.
       <p>
  <li> The service can be used by non-trusted clients.  It is possible
       (and quite common) to give a user the ability to invoke a
       domain without giving them the authority to access the code or
       data in that domain.
</ul>
<p> The primary disadvantage to this approach is that invoking a
domain is somewhat more expensive than performing a library call.
<h2>1.1 A Pure Capability System</h2>
<p> EROS domains - in fact, all EROS objects - are named by one or
more secure <strong>capabilities</strong>.  A capability uniquely
identifies some particular object in the system, and describes the
operations that can be performed on that object using that capability.
The capabilities held by a process determine both what objects can be
accessed and what operations can be performed.  In EROS, there is no
notion of ``opening'' an object to determine the user's authority.
Holding a capability is a <em>necessary and sufficient</em> condition
for object access.  Security is assured by never handing a capability
to a user who should not have it.
<p> Capabilities solve three difficult operating system problems:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> They provide a single, unified mechanism for object naming at
       all levels of the memory hierarchy.  In particular, the same
       capability is used for both the in-memory and on-disk forms of
       EROS objects.
       <p>
  <li> They provide a uniform mechanism for naming both hardware and
       software resources.  Capabilities are used in EROS to name
       devices, data pages, and callable processes.
       <p>
  <li> They provide an extremely simple and flexible mechanism for
       access protection.  The principle of least privilege (programs
       should have the privilege that they need, and no more) is
       simpler to realize with capabilities than with access-control
       based protection mechanisms.
</ul>
<p> In EROS, capabilities are the <em>only</em> way of obtaining
access to objects.  Every domain has 16 capability registers, and can
directly access the objects named by those capabilities.  The
capabilities held by a domain determine both what objects can be
accessed and what operations can be performed by that domain.
<p> In practice, the term ``capability'' is cumbersome to say and a
pain in the neck to type.  In EROS, capabilities are almost always
referred to as <strong>keys</strong>.
<h2>1.2 A Database Example</h2>
<p> To give an example of the impact of active persistent agents,
consider the problem of keeping a small database, such as a password
file, that is used by a number of related programs.  In UNIX, this
would be done using a library package called <em>dbm</em> (or these
days, <em>ndbm</em>), as shown in Figure 1.1.  The dbm
package constructs and maintains a keyed-index file.  Provided that
all parties access the file using the dbm routines, all is well.
<p>
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- UnixPwd.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.1: UNIX password file management
</ul>
<p> There are several problems with this approach:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The password file is visible in the file system, and accessible
       to any program with sufficient authority.
       <p>
  <li> There is no way to <em>guarantee</em> that all programs which
       access the file do so using the dbm package, which raises the
       possibility that the file might become corrupted through no
       fault of the dbm package.
       <p>
  <li> If a new, more efficient keyed-index file mechanism becomes
       available, there is no way to introduce it without recompiling
       and replacing all of the existing applications and rewriting
       the existing data sets.
       <p>
  <li> Worse, there is no way to test the new version in a production
       setting without disrupting the existing applications.
       <p>
  <li> The applications that access the file need special authorities,
       in this case the superuser privilege.
</ul>
<p> In the EROS system, this problem is solved using a domain to
manage the password data, as shown in Figure 1.2.
Access to the data is possible only by invoking the domain, and the
domain can only be invoked by holders of appropriate capabilities.
The content of the password database is held within the memory of the
keyed-index manager.  Since the password manager domain, and the
capabilities that authorize access to it, are preserved across system
restarts, there is no need for any sort of file, and no possibility
that an unauthorized party will gain access to the data.  Further,
there is no need for the programs to have any special privileges.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ErosPwd.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.2: EROS password management
</ul>
<p> This approach is possible for two reasons:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> Capabilities provide fine-grain access control, eliminating the
       need for cumbersome blanket authorities.
       <p>
  <li> Processes do not die, so there is no need to place the
       information (in this case the content of the password database)
       in a publicly accessible location.
</ul>
<p> Two other benefits may not be obvious from the discussion.  First,
there is no need to encrypt the passwords.  The content of the
keyed-index manager is not readable by anyone else, so there is no
concern about password cracking.  Second, and more important, the
whole problem was solved without the need for writing any special
software to deal with issues of security.  It is important to make
sure that only authorized programs hold capabilities to the
keyed-index manager, but no special programming was necessary within
the keyed index manager or the applications to deal with privilege
issues.
<h2>1.3 The Confused Deputy</h2>
<p> The password file problem is a useful example, because it is
simple to describe and exposes a large number of potential flaws in
the authority model of a system.  Ultimately, however, the <em>ad
hoc</em> approaches to authority management provided by UNIX and
Windows is adequate to solve these problems.  Here is a more difficult
example.
<p> Suppose you are testing a new product, and you need to obtain
usage statistics.  The problem is that you do not want the user
altering the usage statistics file.  In UNIX, the usual solution would
be to make the program file for the application <em>setuid</em>,
giving it the authority to create and manipulate a file that the user
cannot.  Seems simple enough.
<p> Suppose, however, that the program is a compiler, and allows the
user to specify where a listing file should be written.  Our user,
P. R.  Nicious, does not want her activities logged.  She discovers
that the log file is stored in <code>/etc/logfile</code>, and directs
the compiler to write its listing file to <code>/etc/logfile</code>
rather than to her own directory.
<p> What happens at this point is not at all pretty.  Depending on the
programmer, there are several possibilities:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The compiler author was only concerned about creating the log
       file, and did not stop to consider the perverse abuses possible
       with this solution.  The listing file gets written to
       <code>/etc/logfile</code>, probably intermingled with the
       proper data.
       <p>
  <li> The compiler author <em>did</em> stop to consider pernicious
       use, and bulletproofed the program before distributing it.  The
       program carefully checks to verify that its logfile is not
       compromised.  Now, however, H. Acker comes along and says to
       write the listing to the system password file.  The log file is
       protected, but the system is not.
</ul>
<p> On the face of it, the second case looks solvable, but it isn't.
The next move is to check for any file in the <code>/etc</code>
directory, but H. Acker will then abuse something else, such as
<code>/bin/sh</code>.  After that, the next thing to try is to write
the listing file to the same directory as the output file.  H. Acker
will just send the output file to a suitably perverse place.  How
about the same directory as the source code?  Better, but still not a
solution.  The source code may be in an inappropriate location.
Besides, doing this defeats the flexibility of being able to say where
the listing should go, which is highly desirable.
<p> So the operating system designer comes along and says: ``I'll make
it possible for a program to have authorities, but arrange only to use
them when it intends to.''  Basically, this distinguishes between a
program's authorities, which are the rights that it has the ability to
use, and its <em>effective</em> authorities, which are the rights that
it is using at any given instant.  This is in fact the UNIX solution.
While it narrows the window of vulnerability, it is extremely
difficult to maintain correctly over time.  Eventually some maintainer
who does not understand the full delicacy of a piece of code will
introduce a security flaw.
<p> You can see that we're on a slippery slope here.  Rather than
arrive at a principled solution (impossible in the UNIX security
model), we find ourselves engaged in an intellectual duel with all
potential attackers.  It's wasted effort.
<p> The problem arises because the program is operating under two
incompatible authorities.  It is deputized to act under the user's
authorities, which are necessary in order to write the output file,
and simultaneously deputized to act under the developer's authorities,
which are necessary to update the log file.  We say that such a
program is a <em>confused deputy</em>.  While the ``effective
authority'' mechanism does solve the problem, it is not maintainable.
<p> The EROS approach is simply to install a capability in the program
that allows it to write the information to a segment.  The segment is
neither visible to nor accessable by the user, and there is no
possibility that the user will contrive to write it inappropriately.
In effect, the log file is a part of the compiler itself.  As with the
solution to the password file problem, this solution is only possible
because programs in EROS are persistent.
<h1>2 The Object System</h1>
<p> Before describing how EROS processes work, we need to switch gears
for a moment to introduce the EROS object system.  At the most basic
level are two simpler objects: pages and nodes.  All other objects in
the EROS system are either directly implemented by the kernel or
synthesized from pages and nodes.
<h2>2.4 Numbers</h2>
<p> A <strong>number</strong> is just what it sounds like.  Numbers
are unsigned 80 bit integers.  In fact, the value of a number object
is stored in the key itself, and no actual object is constructed.
Number keys exist because it is occasionally useful to be able to
store integer values in key slots.  Register values, for example, are
often encoded as number keys.
<h2>2.5 Pages</h2>
<p> A <strong>page</strong> contains user data.  The size of a page
depends on the hardware architecture, but in all current
implementations is 4096 bytes.  A user who holds an appropriate key
for a page can read and write the content of the page.  It is also
possible to have a read-only key for a page.
<p> In most systems, pages are ephemeral.  Unless their content is
explicitly written to a file somewhere, it is lost when the machine
shuts down.  Pages reside in main memory, and typically have no direct
relationship to the unit of storage on the disk (sectors).
<p> By contrast, EROS pages are persistent.  When we refer to a page
in EROS, we are referring to a unit of <em>disk</em> storage.  The
number of pages in the system depends on the amount of disk storage
that is present and how it has been configured.  The EROS kernel uses
main memory as a cache, transparently loading and removing pages from
main memory as needed.
<p> Pages have two associated types of keys.  A <strong>read-only page
key</strong> allows the holder to read, but not write, the content of
the named page.  A <strong>read-write page key</strong> allows the
content to be both read and written.
<h2>2.6 Nodes</h2>
<p> Where a page holds a fixed amount of user data, a
<strong>node</strong> holds 16 capabilities.  Unlike a page, users
have no direct access to the capabilities contained in a node Because
keys are the basic protection mechanism of the EROS system, it is
important that users not be able to modify them.  A holder of a node
key can copy a key from one slot to another in a node, or to some
other node, but cannot directly manipulate the bits within the key.
Nodes can not be mapped into a user address space or otherwise
directly manipulated.
<p> Like pages, a node is a unit of disk storage that is transparently
cached in main memory on demand.  Every page and node in the system is
uniquely identified by an <strong>object identifier</strong>, or OID.
When a process invokes a capability for an object that is not in
memory, the kernel transparently reads the object off of the disk.  As
objects age, they are discarded from main memory.  Aside from a few
bookkeeping tables kept by the kernel, all of main memory is used as a
cache of the state on the disk.
<p> Also like pages, nodes have both read-write and read-only keys.
Nodes have an additional key type known as a <strong>sensory
key</strong>.  Sensory keys were invented to allow the creator of a
segment to ensure that the content reachable from a cannot be altered.
If the creator hands out a read-only key to a node, the node cannot be
altered, but any read-write keys that are in that node can be accessed
and invoked.  A sensory key is like a read-only, but any keys that are
read by way of a sensory key are downgraded to sensory status.  Thus,
no key obtained directly or indirectly through a sensory key will
allow an object to be modified.
<p> Note that pages and nodes are not allocated by the EROS kernel.
Initially all of the pages and nodes in the system are held by a
process called the <strong>space bank</strong>.  Programs needing a
page obtain one from the space bank.  Pages and nodes are transferred,
but never created or destroyed.
<h2>2.7 Segments</h2>
<p> A <strong>segment</strong> provides addressable storage.  Segments
are synthesized out of pages, which hold the actual data, and
<strong>nodes</strong>, which hold capabilities that describe how
these pages are organized.  The simplest kind of segment is simply a
flat sequence of pages.  This sort of segment is commonly used in EROS
where other systems would construct a file.
<p> Segments are constructed in a tree-structured fashion.  Every node
in the tree has up to 16 children, and the leaves of the tree are the
pages holding the actual data.  An 18 page, contiguous segment is
shown in Figure 1.3.  The maximum segment size supported
by the current EROS implementation is 2<super>64</super> bytes.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ContigSeg.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.3: An 18 page contiguous segment
</ul>
<p> A segment does not have to be fully populated.  Two programs
running the same code might share a common subsegment and have
different data pages, as shown in Figure 1.4.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- SharedSubSeg.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.4: Two segments with shared substructure
</ul>
<p> Every valid domain has installed in it a capability that names
address space segment of that domain.  An address space segment is
simply an ordinary segment that happens to be acting as the address
space for a domain.  A typical address space segment has a large gap
between the top of the heap and the bottom of the stack.
<p> Two or more domains can share segments with common substructure,
as shown in Figure 1.4, or can share a complete
segment.  In the latter case, the domains can act as multiple threads
on that segment.
<p> As with nodes, there are both read-only and read-write segment
keys.  Since a segment key does not enable the slots of the segment
node to be examined, no sensory segment key is needed.
<p> Readers who are familiar with memory management may notice a
suspicious similarity between the segment structure and the structure
of the hardware page tables.  The segment structure is in fact derived
from the page table notion.
<h3>2.7.1 Handling Segment Exceptions</h3>
<p> While we will deal with exception handling in greater detail
later, it is worth mentioning here that EROS distinguishes between
<em>access</em> faults and <em>execution</em> faults.  Access faults
occur when a domain attempts to read or write a segment.  Execution
faults occur when the program executes an erroneous instruction.  Some
segments have an associated exception handler, known as a
<strong>segment keeper</strong>.
<p> If a segment keeper is specified, access fault notifications are
directed to the segment keeper rather than the domain keeper.  The
EROS kernel encapsulates the fault information and sends a message to
the segment keeper describing the nature of the access violation.
Usually, the segment keeper will attempt to correct the problem and
restart the faulting instruction.
<p> In practice, it is quite common for many programs to share a
common segment keeper.  Since a key to the faulting segment is passed
to the keeper with each fault, a single keeper can service multiple
segments.
<p> The segment keeper mechanism is used in several ways.  First, it
is used to implement dynamically expandable stacks and heaps.  When a
program needs to grow either the stack or the heap, it makes a
reference to an invalid page.  The fault is directed to the segment
keeper, which acquires a new page on behalf of the program, plugs it
in, and lets the program resume.
<p> Access faults are also used to implement ``copy on write''
semantics.  If two programs require access to the same initial
information, but neither should see the alterations made by the other,
a copy on write segment is created.  Read accesses are allowed to
proceed, but write accesses cause an access fault.  The COW Segment
Keeper resolves these faults by copying the read-only data into a new,
modifiable page and resuming the process.
<p> These two examples touch on an important side point: all
allocation of storage in the EROS system is done by user level code.
The kernel's job is simply to provide protected access to the existing
resources.
<h3>2.7.2 Page Faults</h3>
<p> While access exceptions are passed to the segment keeper, <em>page
faults</em> are not considered access exceptions.  EROS views main
memory as a cache of the disk.  Access violations that indicate page
faults are transparently handled by the kernel.
<h2>2.8 Domains</h2>
<p> A <strong>domain</strong> holds a set of registers for a program.
In addition, it names the segment containing the program's code and
data, the schedule that authorizes the domain to execute, and the
authorities held by the domain.  Every domain contains
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The data registers for the program, which depend on the
       domain's processor architecture.
       <p>
  <li> A key to the domain's address space segment,
       <p>
  <li> A key to the domain's schedule,
       <p>
  <li> 16 Key Registers
       <p>
  <li> A start key for the domain's exception handler, which is known
       as a <strong>domain keeper</strong>.
</ul>
<p> This storage is structured as a collection of three nodes, known
as the <strong>domain root</strong>, <strong>general registers
node</strong> and <strong>key registers node</strong>.  The key
registers node simply holds 16 keys.  The general registers node
contains the register values for the process, encoded as
<strong>number keys</strong>.  The interesting part of a domain is the
<strong>domain root</strong>.  Slots in the domain root are shown in
Table 1.1.  Any slot not explicitly mentioned is
either zero or used to hold register values that do not fit in the
general registers node.

  </table>
  <strong>Table 1.1: Domain Root Slots</strong>
</ul>
<p> Some of these slots deserve further explanation.  The message
buffer page and the brand are described later in the book.
<p> There are several types of keys to domains.  A <strong>domain
key</strong> is handed to the user who first creates the domain.  It
allows the register set to be examined, the key registers to be
accessed, and the address space segment, schedule, and message buffer
page to be altered.  In addition, the state of the process within the
domain can be altered using the domain key.
<p> Most important, however, the domain key can be used to create a
<strong>start key</strong> for the program in the domain.  When a
program invokes a start key, it causes the domain named by the start
key to begin execution.
<h3>2.8.3 The Schedule</h3>
<p> The schedule key indicates the minimum priority at which this
domain will execute.  If the domain is called by a higher-priority
domain, it inherits the priority of the caller to prevent priority
inversion.  In order to run at all, however, a domain must have a
proper schedule capability installed in it.
<p> Future versions of EROS will provide hard real-time scheduling
facilities, at which time Schedules will become real objects.
<h3>2.8.4 Key Registers</h3>
<p> Every domain has a node that holds its 16 key registers.
Capabilities in EROS live in protected kernel space, and are directly
accessable only to the kernel.  A process can copy a capability from a
slot on one node to a slot in another (i.e. can request that the
kernel perform the copy on its behalf), but can neither read nor write
the key itself.  When invoking or passing a key, the process
identifies the key by giving the index of the slot in the general keys
node that contains the desired key.
<p> In practice, few EROS domains need more than 16 keys.  If more are
needed, the process can acquire additional nodes in which to store
them.  This is equivalent to what happens with data registers on a
RISC machine: values must be moved into the data registers before they
can be operated on.
<h3>2.8.5 The Domain Keeper</h3>
<p> The domain keeper's job is to handle any execution faults that may
occur while the domain is running.  If, for example the domain
performs a divide by zero, the kernel sends a message to the domain
keeper on behalf of the domain, indicating what happened.  The domain
keeper either corrects the problem and restarts the domain, or
performs whatever action is appropriate when the domain's state is
unrecoverable.  As with segments, it is quite common for many domains
to use the same keeper.
<p> The net effect of the keeper design is that the kernel has no
policy control over how exceptions are handled.  It's only job is to
encapsulate the exception in a message.  The actual decision about
what to do and how to do it is handled in user-level code.
<h2>2.9 Other Objects</h2>
<p> You have now seen essentially all of the EROS object system.
Segments and domains are crafted out of nodes. Different capability
types are used to keep track of the types of the objects.
<p> In addition to the objects you have seen, devices and kernel
services are controlled by capabilities.  We will defer a discussion
of devices and kernel services for a later chapter.
<h1>3 Structure of an EROS Process</h1>
<p> Now that you have seen all of the pieces, let's look at how they
are put together and get a notion of what exactly a EROS process is.
A process is constructed out of three components: a segment, a
schedule, and a domain, as shown in Figure 1.5.  The
segment provides the executable code and data that is used by the
process.  The domain contains the registers and authorities, and the
schedule describes when and how the domain will run.
<ul>

  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- CompleteDomain.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.5: A complete domain
</ul>
<p> As the program in the domain executes, code and data references
are made into the address space segment.  Faults are reflected to
either the segment or domain keepers, and the process can invoke keys
by naming the key registers that hold them.
<h2>3.10 Key Invocation and Messages</h2>
<p> EROS objects are invoked by sending messages.  A message consists
of a <em>request code</em>, up to one page of data, and up to four
capabilities.  Everything except the data is passed in registers,
making the message system very fast.  The fixed length of messages is
crucial to the performance and reliability of the EROS kernel, as it
guarantees that message passing can be implemented as an atomic
operation.  If needed, larger amounts of data can be sent by passing a
segment key in the message.
<p> At any given moment, a domain exists in one of three states:
<center>
  <table width=90%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td>
	<strong>running</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
	A running domain is currently executing code.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td>
	<strong>waiting</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
	A waiting domain has invoked a capability and is waiting for
	the result.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td>
	<strong>available</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
	An available domain has returned to its last caller and is
	ready to accept its next message.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> Keys are invoked by performing a <strong>fork</strong>,
<strong>call</strong>, or <strong>return</strong> operation.  The
<em>fork</em> operation sends a message to the recipient, and leaves
both caller and receiver running.  Unless the caller makes explicit
provision for a response, the receiver has no way to reply.
<p> The <em>call</em> operation causes the caller to block until the
receiver has replied.  The kernel fabricates a <strong>resume
key</strong> to the caller, and inserts it into the message as the
fourth key argument.  A distinct resume key is generated for each call
invocation.  Invoking any resume key for a given call causes all other
resume keys for that call to be destroyed.  This ensures that there
will be only one reply to a given call.
<p> The <em>return</em> operation causes the sender to become
available, and allows the recipient to resume execution.  The second
and subsequent attempts to invoke a resume key cause the kernel to
silently consume the message and place the sender in the available
state.
<p> These state transitions are summarized in
Table 1.2.

<h3>3.10.6 Message Buffering</h3>
<p> Messages are not buffered by the kernel.  If the recipient is not
<em>available</em> (call, fork) or <em>waiting</em> (return), the caller
blocks until the recipient is in the appropriate state to accept the
message.  This is contrary to the conventional practice in microkernel
design.  There are several reasons that messages are not buffered:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> EROS is intended to become a real-time system.  Message
       queueing introduces a variety of scheduling complications that
       are best avoided.
       <p>
  <li> Message queues raise some challenging design questions:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <p>
	 <li> How does a debugger get access to the content of the
	      message queue?
	      <p>
	 <li> What authority is required to do so?
	      <p>
	 <li> What operations, if any, can be performed on messages in
	      a queue? Is it, for example, legal to delete a message
	      in transit, and what would it mean to do so?
	      <p>
	 <li> How are message queue contents to be saved at checkpoint
	      time?
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Most of the messaging activity on the system is call/return.
       Since the caller isn't going anywhere until the reply comes
       back, there is no real benefit to copying the message into the
       kernel.  Queuing the processes themselves achieves essentially
       the same effect with no additional data copying, and removes
       the need for explicit message priorities.
</ul>
<p> Each of these issues is, in our view, a compelling reason not to
implement kernel-queued messages.  Ultimately, applications that
require message queueing can implement it in a user-level domain.
This approach has the added advantage that the user is in total
control of the messaging policy.
<h3>3.10.7 Kernel Keys</h3>
<p> Since the kernel is not a domain, kernel keys behave slightly
differently than domains.  A <em>call</em> to a kernel key generates a
reply.  A <em>fork</em> to a kernel key will perform the operation for
side effects (if any), but does not return to the caller.  A <em>
return</em> to a kernel key will perform the operation for side effects
and place the caller in the <em>available</em> state.
<h1>4 Checkpoint, Migration, and Recovery</h1>
<p> One of the keys to EROS is the checkpoint and recovery system.  As
we have already described, every page and node in the system has an
official home location on a disk, and modified objects are
periodically written back to their home locations.
<p> In fact, the implementation is a bit more complicated, because of
the need for recovery.  Conceptually, EROS disk storage can be divided
into two areas: object home locations and the checkpoint log.  As
execution proceeds, dirty objects are appended to the checkpoint log.
When space in the checkpoint log runs low, or the time comes to
checkpoint, all dirty objects are forced out to the log (by paging)
and a checkpoint is declared.  The resulting disk structure is shown
in Figure 1.6.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- CkptLog.eps -->
  <p> Figure 1.5: Disk regions in EROS
</ul>
<p> Whenever a new checkpoint is successfully flushed to disk, the
migrator is started.  The migrator copies the objects contained in the
checkpoint back to their official home locations, and then releases
the associated space in the log.
<p> When loading an object from disk, the EROS kernel first checks the
checkpoint image(s) in the log starting with the most recent.  If the
object is not found in the checkpoint log, it is retrieved from its
home location.
<p> The end result is that the system can fail at any time and is
always able to recover.  On startup, the kernel scans the checkpoint
log to find all of the completed checkpoint images.  It proceeds from
the logical system image captured in the most recent completed
checkpoint.  If necessary, it also restarts the migrator.
<p> In practice, objects are written to the log asynchronously.
Before an in-memory object is modified, EROS reserves space for it in
the log.  The pager writes the objects to these locations as
necessary, so by the time a checkpoint is declared the log is mostly
populated.  When the time comes to take a checkpoint, all of the
remaining dirty objects in memory are marked ``copy on write,'' and
execution is allowed to proceed.  These ``copy on write'' objects are
slowly flushed out to disk as execution continues.  When all of the
dirty objects have been written to disk, the checkpoint area header is
rewritten to indicate that a successful checkpoint has been taken.
<p> This approach has two useful consequences:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> Checkpoint is fast.  The system halts only long enough to mark
       objects copy on write.  It does not wait for the actual I/O to
       complete.
       <p>
  <li> Checkpoint has low space overhead.  Previous generations of
       EROS used two fixed-size save areas and switched back and forth
       between them.  Using a circular log cuts the required space to
       support checkpoint in half.
</ul>
<p> In addition to the altered objects, each checkpoint image contains
a list of the processes that were running at the time of the
checkpoint.  When the system restarts, it locates the most recently
completed checkpoint, reads the process list, and uses that list to
resume execution.
