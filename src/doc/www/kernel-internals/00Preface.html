<h1 align=right>Preface</h1>
<p> So here it is 1995, and we are undertaking to build yet another
operating system.  Surely by now this is a mature field, and the
construction of new operating systems for general use is largely a
wasted effort?
<p> While we could offer a suitably long-winded and dull
justification, it may be simpler to offer an observation made by
Elliott Organick in 1983:
<p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The failure to solve the general protection problem by prior
  architectures (descriptor based or not) has had serious
  consequences.  It has meant, for example, that system software
  modules must be set apart and explicitly protected from application
  programs; the former cannot be permitted to <em>trust</em> the
  integrity of in-bound pointer arguments such as descriptors.  This
  dispartiy has, in turn, made it imptactical and unsage to permit
  users the freedom to substitute their own versions of selected
  modules.  A frequent consequence has been that much software within
  a system tends to be relegated to a small number of very large
  (monolithic) <em>protection domains</em>.  This consequence, in
  turn, leads to high software maintenance costs.

<p>
<!--  Organick's comments are novel only for being so clearly stated.
Protection wasn't a new problem then, and it remains essentially
unsolved in today's computing systems. -->
<p> While a great number of operating systems have been built over the
years, the field remains immature.  We know a great deal, for example,
about ways to get high performance out of disk drives.  Though most of
what we know has not shown up in mainstream implementations yet, we
know quite a lot about how to do fast networking.  We even know a fair
bit about process scheduling.
<p> For all of that, there is a lot that we do <em>not</em> yet have a
good handle on in the OS field:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Graceful degradation</em> - When the going gets tough,
       today's operating systems either crash or kill user programs.
       This reflects some basic flaws in their underlying design.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Reliability</em> - Today's systems are embarassingly
       unreliable.  A top of the line UNIX server, carefully
       administered, may continue running for as long as one month
       between crashes.  Failure times for other mainstream operating
       systems are comparable.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Security</em> - We have invested a great deal of effort
       into the so-called ``Orange Book'' security levels, which are
       concerned with access prevention.  The real-world goal is not
       to prevent all access to a system, but to provide carefully
       controlled access in a hostile environment.  This is a much
       harder problem, and today's systems really aren't designed for
       it.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Mechanism v/s policy</em> - Because many resource
       management policies have been implemented in privileged code,
       we lack the ability to experiment with alternative policies.
</ul>
<p> This book describes EROS, the Extremely Reliable Operating System.
It provides an introduction to the system architecture as seen by the
programmer, and describes the kernel that supports this architecture.
The book describes the kernel in considerable detail, and is intended
to be read with the kernel sources at hand.  It is concerned not only
with describing <em>what</em> the kernel is doing, but <em>why</em>.
Some of the things we have chosen <em>not</em> to do are as important
as the things we have done, and where we are able to identify such
choices we have tried to do so.  In at least one case, we have
implemented an algorithm that is well known to have theoretically
better alternatives.  In practice, we found that the better
alternatives weren't really better.
<p> In constructing EROS, we are trying to build a system that will
let us get a better handle on these issues, as well as on the issues
like distribution and scalability.
<p> EROS is highly scalable.  A stripped-down version is small enough
for embedded control and handheld applications, while the full
implementation can handle systems with many terrabytes of disk space.
<H1>The Kernel</h1>
<p> EROS is built as a small microkernel.  The microkernel provides a
small set of system services, including message passing, object and
capability management, process scheduling, checkpointing, and a small
number of kernel services.  In addition, it includes drivers for disks
and a few selected devices.  The kernel is the only portion of the
system that runs with supervisor priviledge.
<p> The system is quite small.  Them microkernel itself takes up
between 45 and 60 kilobytes of code, depending on the processor and
compiler used.  When running, the entire system footprint is less than
8% of the machine's available memory.  Almost all of this space goes
to tables that are used to keep track of the status of each page of
system memory.
<p> The small size of the EROS kernel is deceptive.  The system is
fast and extremely powerful.  Our benchmarks indicate that it's
performance competes very favorably with Windows and UNIX.  This is a
major jump in microkernel performance.  While microkernels have always
promised to deliver high performance, few have actually delivered on
this promise.
<p> While small, the EROS system provides some rather unusual
facilities.  A periodic checkpoint mechanism ensures that if the
system fails, no more than a few minutes of work is lost.  On restart,
all applications pick up pretty much where they left off.  It is
possible to host other operating systems on top of EROS.  The EROS
development environment is an example of such a system.  In addition,
we are buildling binary compatible UNIX and Windows subsystems.
<H1>A Pure Capability Architecture</h1>
<p> Every object in the EROS system, including processes, has a unique
internal name.  Access to objects is through <em>capabilities</em>,
which combine an object's name with an authority.  The holder of a
read-only capability for a particular page of memory, for example, can
read but not write that page.  To write the page, a read-write
capability would be required.
<p> Capabilities are the <em>only</em> way to gain access to an
object.  If a program does not posess a capability for an object, it
cannot access the object.  Posession of a capability is a
<em>necessary and sufficient</em> condition for accessing the object.
As a result, the system is extremely secure.  Security is maintained
by making sure that capabilities are never handed to inappropriate
users.  It is extremely difficult to attack such a system with
software viruses.
<p> The use of capabilities leads to several simplifications of the
kernel.  The EROS kernel knows nothing of users, groups, and
authorization, and cares less.  There is no need for a hierarchy of
privileges as found in other systems, and no need for the kernel to
support them.
<H1>A Persistent System</h1>
<p> Objects in EROS are persistent.  Once allocated, an object will
continue to exist until it is explicitly deconstructed.  Previous
systems have provided persistence for data objects, such as pages and
segments (files).  EROS provides persistence for processes as well.
Once created, an EROS process continues to execute forever -- even
across system shutdowns.
<p> Because processes are persistent, EROS is ideal for building
highly reliable applications.  Applications can be divided into
components that run as individual processes.  These components are
protected from each other, and can be tested in isolation.  The impact
of this is staggering.  Suppose you have a million line UNIX program,
and some routine somewhere has managed to corrupt a pointer.  With all
of the tracking tools available today, such bugs are very hard to
locate.  The problem usually shows up in some completely unrelated
code, and is isolated only with tremendous difficulty.  In EROS
applications, the components tend to run as seperate programs, and are
unable to corrupt each other.  This makes it much easier to find the
guilty party.
<p> To support this style of application construction, EROS provides
an extremely fast interprocess communication facility. This facility
is the most heavily exercised portion of the kernel, and went through
several redesigns before we were finally satisfied with it.
<p> Persistence also means that there is no need for a
kernel-supported file system.  The basic purpose of a file system is
to provide a name space that persists across system shutdowns.  Since
processes do not go away when the system is shut down, this
functionality is not required by the kernel.  Name spaces are
implemented outside the kernel, and are completely independent of
system security.
<H1>Audience</h1>
<p> This book is ultimately intended to have several audiences.  In
chronological order (from earliest readers to latest):
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> Myself, as a design check.
       <p>
  <li> Members of the EROS research group at the University of
       Pennsylvania, who are working on both kernel and domain-level
       programming.
       <p>
  <li> Early users who will undoubtedly be kernel developers in their
       own right.
       <p>
  <li> Researchers who are interested in the design basis for this
       system.
       <p>
  <li> Students who wish to learn about reliable software
       construction, or are interested in EROS in connection with a
       course in operating systems.
       <p>
  <li> Technical readers, who have learned of EROS and want to know
       something of how it is put together.
</ul>
<p> This book is <em>not</em> designed as a primary textbook for an
operating systems course.  It would be an excellent choice for a
laboratory course, or for a practically-oriented course if
supplemented by a more abstract textbook.  The decision not to make
this a textbook was deliberate, and is probably worth explaining.
<p> In mid-1995, Mitch Marcus, Ken Church, and I were comparing notes
on incoming hires.  Over a period of several years, we had noticed
that young computer scientists are less and less able to write real
programs.  Mitch was finding this true at the graduate student level,
Ken at the industrial research level, and I in commercial development.
We found this puzzling, and started trying to figure out what was
going on.  After a while, we realized that all of the good computer
programmers we know have something in common: they have all read and
learned from the works of others.  There really isn't any substitute
for reading good source code to learn how to program.  Fewer and fewer
students have any opportunity to do this, and it shows.
<p> Back in the 1970's, John Lyons wrote a book providing a
line-by-line annotated discussion of the UNIX v6 source code.  The
book violated AT\&amp;T's copyright and trade secret agreement, and
was quickly withdrawn, but an entire generation of programmers made
photocopies and learned from this book and the accompanying source
code.  Unfortunately, the UNIX source code has always been licensed in
ways that prevent an operating systems course from teaching it.
EROS's licensing terms are somewhat less onerous.
<p> At the risk of arrogance, EROS is an example of good code.  The
architecture of the system is clear and simple, and the implementation
is straightforward and well documented.  In addition, it is small
enough for a single person to learn.
<H1>Organization of the Book</h1>
<p> This book is organized in several parts.  Part I provides an
overview of the EROS architecture.  The EROS system is conceptually
different from most current operating systems, and the overview will
help to bring the new reader up to speed on the EROS view of things.
In particular, this part provides a clear description of the EROS
process model and object model, which is a necessary precursor to
deciding if the operating system is correct.  In addition, Part I
introduces the guiding principles that have influenced the system
design, and clearly describes the objectives of the EROS
implementation.
<p> Part II turns to the implementation of the kernel itself.  It
describes the structure of the EROS kernel, and examines the
implementation in careful detail.  We describe the key algorithms and
subsystems in the kernel, including discussion of possible alternative
implementations.
<p> Part III describes the basic system services that are provided
with the EROS system.  A great deal of key functionality is
implemented outside of the kernel.  Though these services run outside
of the kernel, they are every bit as critical as the kernel services.
No description of the system would be complete without them.
<p> Part IV describes the EROS development environment.  The EROS
development environment is a full POSIX-compliant environment hosted
on top of the EROS system.
<p> One problem with describing microkernels is that they are fairly
machine dependent.  Because it is the most readily available platform,
this book describes the Intel version of the EROS system.  Throughout,
we have tried to be explicit about identifying those aspects of the
presentation that are a result of the Intel processor.  If possible, I
hope to include a description of a second implementation as well.
<H1>A Note on the Code Samples</h1>
<p> Where including the code for a routine or a structure declaration
from the EROS kernel helps to illustrate a point, we have inserted the
code in the book.  Often, such structures and routines must handle
lots of details in addition to the key points being illustrated, and
where this is true we have elided the portions that distract from the
point at hand.  Where the purpose and implementation of a routine
should be fairly obvious from context, we have ommitted the routine
from the book altogether. For example, the <code>ThreadLink</code>
structure, which first appears in Figure~\ref{fig:ThreadClass},
includes the declaration of the <code>ThreadLink::Unlink()</code>
routine, though the source code does not appear anywhere in the book.
<p> As always, the place to look to get an exhaustive view of the
details is the source code.  The complete source code for the
uniprocessor EROS kernel can be found online in a variety of
locations, or can be obtained from the publishers.
<H1>About the Author</h1>
<p> Jonathan Shapiro's early career started in programming
environments and languages.  He was one of the earliest users and
authors on the C++ programming language, and was the original
architect of the Silicon Graphics CASE product line, most notably
their debugger.  In more recent years, he has been involved in
microprocessor architecture and operating system design, with
particular emphasis on reliability and real-time facilities.  He first
started working on EROS in 1992.
<p> <em>The above paragraph is strictly a placeholder.</em>
<H1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p> Quite a number of people deserve thanks and acknowledgement for
this work.
<p> <strong>Norm Hardy</strong> was the architect of KeyKOS, a near
predecessor to EROS, and spent a large amount of time discussing both
the KeyKOS and the EROS architecture with me.  <strong>Bill
Frantz</strong> and <strong>Charlie Landau</strong>, also from the
original KeyKOS team, have participated in various EROS and KeyKOS
discussions as well.
<p> <strong>Bryan Ford</strong> of the University of Utah has also put
forward a lot of useful suggestions.  Bryan is the principle force
behind Mach version 4, and has done extensive work on fast IPC.  His
thoughts and suggestions at various points were pivotal, and his
experience with the Intel architecture was extremely helpful in
building the first implementation.
<p> <strong>Dave Farber</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Smith</strong>
of the University of Pennsylvania provided feedback and suggestions
over several years.  The final implementation of EROS happened as part
of my thesis work, and Dave and Jonathan were my advisors on that
path.  In addition, they have been remarkably tolerant of my
occasional diversions.
<p> <strong>Charles Smith</strong> of Filoli Information Systems
provided an odd sort of moral support.  Though he often claimed that
he couldn't figure out why I thought <em>I</em> should be doing this,
he simultaneously maintained that building EROS was a good idea and
should be pursued.
<p>
<!--  <h1>1 Some History</h1> -->
<p>
<!-- <p>
Capability architectures have been out of favor since the early '70s.
The earliest multitasking systems were almost all capability systems,
usually implemented in special hardware.  These early systems
struggled with a variety of performance problems.  When MULTICS
arrived in the early '70s, the best minds in the field were seduced
away from the earlier approaches.  All of today's major operating
systems, including UNIX, MVS, VMS, and Windows, can trace their
ancestry back to MULTICS.  In the rush to create them, capability
architectures were largely forgotten.
<p> In spite of this, there are some compelling advantages to
capability systems, and after several years tentative interest in them
began to emerge again.  Intel invested a great deal of effort and
money in the creation of a machine called the 432, which was a
capability architecture.  The 432 was a huge failure, and it is
probably fair to say that it singlehandedly destroyed the credibility
of capability systems for the next 10 years.
<p> EROS attempts to correct these design errors.
<p> EROS continues to implement a few policies within the kernel, but
only where there is a principled and compelling reason to do so.  All
other policy control is implemented by user code. -->
