	    Two topics come up repeatedly on the EROS mailing
	    lists:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		How are capabilities and access control lists
		different?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Is one better than the other? If so, why?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    They come up so frequently because people use these
	    questions as a way to sharpen their understanding of the
	    issues.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One thing that I learned in my own attempts to answer
	    these questions is that the arguments are actually quite
	    complex, and that the first mistake is to oversimplify
	    them when you are trying to get a handle on them. You can
	    simplify the explanation later; first be sure what it is
	    you are trying to explain.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Since it's very easy to miss important details, this note
	    tries to give my current answer to the  first question.
	    It describes how capabilities and access control
	    lists actually work <em>in practice</em>, and therefore
	    how they differ. It may tell you
	    more then you feel you wish to know, but it is as accurate
	    as I can make it without appealing to mathematics.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I clearly have an opinion on the second question, or I
	    wouldn't have built EROS. This note tries not to be
	    partisan, because it is better to understand the basis of
	    the discussion before debating the merits of the outcome.
	  </p>
	  <h1>1. Access Control Lists</h1> 
	  <p>
	    An ACL system has at least
	    five namespaces whose relationships need to be considered:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of file names: /tmp/foo
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of unique object identifiers: (dev 22,
		inode 36, type file) 
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of user identities (uid 52476)
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		For each object type (file, disk, terminal, ...), the
		namespace of operations that object can perform.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of process identifiers (process 719)
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    In an access list system, it is assumed that there are two
	    global mappings:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>principal: process identity -> user identity</tt><br>
	    <tt>fs_lookup: file name -> object identity</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    That is, every process has an assigned user identity
	    and every file name can be translated into a unique object
	    identifier. Hanging off of every unique object is a
	    further mapping:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>acl: (object identity, user identity) -> operation(s)</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Given a process <b>proc</b> that wishes to perform an
	    operation <b>op</b> on an object <b>object</b>, the
	    protection mechanism in an access list system is to test
	    the following predicate: 
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>op in acl(object, principal(p))</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In the special case of the "open" call, this test is
	    modified to be:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>op in acl(fs_lookup(filename), principal(p))</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <h1>2. Capability Systems</h1> 
	  <p>
	    A capability system has at least
	    four namespaces whose relationships need to be considered:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of unique object identifiers: (dev 22,
		inode 36, type file) 
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		For each object type (file, disk, terminal, ...), the
		namespace of operations that object can perform.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of process identifiers (process 719)
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The namespace of capabilities (object 10, operation
		set S)
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    In a capability system, it is assumed that there is one
	    local mapping for each process
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>cap: (process identity, index) -> capability</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    That is, every process has a list of capabilities. Each
	    capability names an object and also names a set of legal
	    operations on that object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    There are also two "accessor" functions:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>obj: capability -> object identity</tt><br>
	    <tt>ops: capability -> operations</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Given a process <b>proc</b> that wishes to perform an
	    operation <b>op</b> on an object <b>object</b>, the
	    process must first possess a capability naming that
	    object. That is, it must possess a capability at some
	    index <b>i</b> such that
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>object == obj(caps(p,i))</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    To perform an operation, the process names the "index"
	    <b>i</b> of that capability to be invoked from the
	    per-process list. The protection mechanism in a capability
	    system is to test the following predicate:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <tt>op in ops(caps(p,i))</tt>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Capability systems typically do not have a distinguished
	    "open" call.
	  </p>
	  <h1>3. Some Differences</h1>
	  <p>
	    <em>This section is incomplete.</em>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Simply comparing the predicates shows that there is a
	    significant difference between the two systems:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top align=left>
		<th>ACL:</th>
		<td>
		  <tt>op in acl(object, principal(p))</tt>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top aligh=left>
		<th>Capability:</th>
		<td>
		  <tt>op in ops(caps(p,i))</tt>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    An obvious difference is that the capability model
	    makes no reference to any notion of "principal".
	  </p>
          <p>
            Another obvious difference is that the capability model
            has a parameter "<tt>i</tt>". This allows the process to specify
            <em>which</em> authority it wants to exercise, which is why
            only the capability model can solve the
            <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/ConfusedDeputy.html">
            confused deputy problem</a>.
          </p>
	  <h2>Access Rights and Persistence</h2>
	  <p>
	    What happens when the computer
	    shuts down and all of the processes disappear?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In an access control list system, this is not a problem,
	    because the login sessions disappear too. The user
	    identity for a process is derived from who starts it,
	    which is in turn derived from the login
	    session. There is no need to record permissions on a
	    per-process basis.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a capability system, there is a definite
	    problem. Solutions vary. Some systems provide a means to
	    "pickle" a process or associate an initial capability list
	    with each login. EROS makes all processes persistent.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Least Privilege</h2>
	  <p>
	    Capability systems allow a finer grain of protection. Each
	    process has an exactly specified set of access rights. In
	    contrast, access control list systems are coarser: every
	    process executed by "fred" has the same rights. If you
	    could always trust your programs, the coarser protection
	    is fine. In an era where computer viruses are front page
	    news, it is clearly necessary to be able to run some
	    programs with finer restrictions than others.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Revocation</h2>
	  <p>
	    In an access control list, you can remove a user from the
	    list, and that user can no longer gain access to the
	    object. In a capability system, there is no equivalent
	    operation.  This is (arguably) a problem. Users come and
	    go on projects, and you'ld like to be able to remove them
	    when they should no longer have access to the project
	    data.  There are mechanisms to manage this in capability
	    systems, but they are cumbersome.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Rights Transfer</h2>
	  <p>
	    In general, an access control list does not (in theory)
	    allow rights transfer. If "fred" obtains access to an
	    object, he cannot give this access to "mary" by
	    transferring the object descriptor after the object has
	    been opened. I say "in theory" because fred can still
	    proxy for mary.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a capability system, capabilities can be
	    transferred. If a process running on behalf of fred can
	    speak to a process running on behalf of mary, then
	    capabilities may be transferred between the two
	    processes. This can be useful: it allows you to hand a
	    capability to a particular document to an editor. It can
	    also be dangerous: if the program you are running is
	    malicious, it can leak your authority.
	  </p>
	  <h1>4. The Equivalence Fallacy</h1>
	  <p>
	    There is an old claim that started appearing very early in
	    papers on protection. The claim is:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    Capabilities and access control lists are equivalent. They
	    are simply two different ways to look at a Lampson access
	    matrix. Any protection state that can be captured with one
	    can be captured with the other.
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    People who have heard of capabilities almost universally
	    believe this claim. Unfortunately, the claim is untrue.
	    Worse, it obscures understanding of protection. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    By way of debunking it, let me first explain what is meant
	    by this statement. Then let's look at why it is incorrect.
	  </p>
	  <h2>The Lampson Access Matrix</h2>
	  <p>
	    The Lampson access matrix provides a way to look at the
	    protection state of a system. It describes the access
	    rights of the system at some instant in time. Each subject
	    (a subject is always a process) in the system has a row in
	    the table and each object (which can be either a process
	    or an object) has a column. The entries in the table
	    describe what access rights subject S has on object O:
	  </p>
	  <center>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td></td>
		<th>
		  O1
		</th>
		<th>
		  O2
		</th>
		<th>
		  O3
		</th>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<th>S1</th>
		<td>
		  r
		</td>
		<td>
		  r,w
		</td>
		<td>
		  x
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<th>S2</th>
		<td>
		  
		</td>
		<td>
		  r
		</td>
		<td>
		  r,w
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    The idea behind the claim is that if you look at a
	    <em>row</em> of the access matrix, you are looking at a
	    capability,
	    and if you look at a 
	    <em>column</em> of the access matrix, you are looking at
	    an access control list entry:
	  </p>
	  </p>
	  <center>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td></td>
		<th>
		  O1
		</th>
		<th>
		  O2
		</th>
		<th>
		  O3
		</th>
		<td>
		</td>
		<td></td>
		<th>
		  O1
		</th>
		<th bgcolor="#d00000">
		  O2
		</th>
		<th>
		  O3
		</th>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<th  bgcolor=cyan>S1</th>
		<td  bgcolor=cyan>
		  r
		</td>
		<td  bgcolor=cyan>
		  r,w
		</td>
		<td  bgcolor=cyan>
		  x
		</td>
		<td>
		</td>
		<th>S1</th>
		<td>
		  r
		</td>
		<td bgcolor="#d00000">
		  r,w
		</td>
		<td>
		  x
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<th>S2</th>
		<td>
		</td>
		<td>
		  r
		</td>
		<td>
		  r,w
		</td>
		<td>
		</td>
		<th>S2</th>
		<td>
		</td>
		<td bgcolor="#d00000">
		  r
		</td>
		<td>
		  r,w
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    Unfortunately, this is wrong.
	  </p>
	  <h2>A Problem of Terminology</h2>
	  <p>
	    In the early security literature there was some sloppy use
	    of the term "subject." In some papers the term "subject"
	    was used to mean "process" while in others it was used to
	    mean "principal" (i.e. a user). If we take subject to mean
	    "principal", then the red column is not a capability;
	    capabilities do not have anything to do with
	    principals. If we take subject to mean "process" then the
	    cyan row is not an access control list. ACLs do not refer
	    to processes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I have pointed this out to theorists who work on formal
	    verification, and I have seen some good ones wave their
	    hands and say "That's not a problem -- just expand all the
	    processes, discard the notion of user, and it all works
	    just fine, and the two models both fit in the matrix."
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is true in some mathematical sense.  The problem is
	    that after you do this you haven't got access control
	    lists any more. Access control lists are specified in
	    terms of users, not processes. One can argue (and I do)
	    that specifying things in terms of processes is the right
	    thing to do, but once you do this expansion you have lost
	    a level of indirection that was crucial in understanding
	    how access control lists work. There are useful properties
	    you can prove about a system with all processes expanded
	    that are not true if the user identity indirection is
	    retained. It all depends on what operations are permitted,
	    which brings me to the second, more serious problem:
	  </p>
	  <h2>A Problem of Evolution</h2>
	  <p>
	    While the terminology problem is fatal, there is a more
	    subtle and more damaging error in the claim: it is a
	    static view of a dynamic system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you freeze a computer system in mid-execution, you can
	    draw an access matrix that describes it's current
	    protection state, and you can ask if that state is
	    okay. This is a very useful thing to be able to do.
	    In practice, however, we aren't so much interested in what
	    the instantaneous state of a system is as in how that
	    state can evolve.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    At a very high level of abstraction, proofs about security
	    mechanisms all work the same way:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		First you define what a "safe" state is. That is, you
		specify what it means for the policy to be enforced.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Second you establish an initial, "safe"
		condition. This is done by setting up the initial
		access matrix that you want. Since you are in control
		of how the access matrix is initialized, you
		<em>should</em> be able to establish just about any
		condition you would like.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The operative word is "should". In some protection
		systems, however, there are constraints on what can
		legally be placed in the matrix. A classical access
		control list system, for example, requires that every
		process owned by the same subject must have the same
		permissions. This means that if P1 and P2 are both
		owned by S1, their rows must be identical.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Unfortunately, it turns out that this is a fairly
		damaging restriction. It can make setting up the
		desired initial conditions extremely difficult
		(sometimes impossible), and it can make the
		verification of security policies mathematically
		undecidable -- which means you can't prove the
		security policy.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Third, you specify what the rules are for how the
		system operates. What are the steps that the machine
		will perform? How does each step affect the access
		matrix (if at all)?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Finally, you prove that if you start from the
		specified initial condition, and you take a sequence
		of steps, you always end up in a "safe"
		state. Actually, you have to show that this is true
		for all possible sequences of steps.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
