	  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
	  <p>
	    It is almost never the hardware.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Software, on the other hand, is both a frequent source of
	    failures <em>and</em> a frequent source of data
	    corruption.  This week's miscomputed result may be a
	    parameter in next week's flight control system.  Data
	    corruption of this sort is hard to find and difficult to
	    recover from.  Using current development disciplines and
	    current operating environments, it is also extremely
	    costly to prevent.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The basic sources of software errors are complexity and
	    mistakes.  Tools and disciplines exist to reduce both, but
	    cannot eliminate them completely.  High-availability
	    applications present a further complication: the need to
	    design for updates and upgrades without downtime.  In the
	    final analysis, <em>the software is complex because the
	    problem is complex</em>. What is needed, then, is a way to
	    make complex software engineerable.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    EROS is a platform for building engineerable software
	    systems.  It has been designed from the ground up with
	    three objectives:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		<b>Simplification</b> in building large systems,
		eliminating as many diversionary requirements as
		possible.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		<b>Containment</b>, allowing the inevitable software
		failures to be caught and recovered from.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		<b>Security</b>, enabling applications to safely
		expose sensitive information in a controlled way.
		EROS provides mechanisms to control not just
		<em>what</em> information the client obtains, but
		<em>how</em>.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    It is also one of the fastest systems currently available
	    from any provider.
	  </p>
	  <h1>2. The Need for Boundaries</h1>
	  <p>
	    <img src="monolithic-app.gif" align=right>
	    Current application development approaches are
	    <em>monolithic</em>.  A sizable group of engineers
	    develops a large number of functional components to
	    address various parts of the requirements.  These parts
	    are then assembled into a single, large application.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This approach has a number of intrinsic flaws:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Too much responsibility is assigned to a single point
		of failure -- the application.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		There is no means to stop one component from damaging
		another.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Handling of exceptional cases is difficult to isolate
		from handling of common, time-critical cases.  This
		negatively impacts both performance and correctness.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Interfaces between components are not precisely
		defined.  This impacts both maintainability and
		testability.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		In the absence of enforcement, the boundaries between
		components become fuzzy as evolution and maintenance
		take their toll on the design.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Components cannot be replaced individually.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The security of the application is all or nothing.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
	        Ancillary operations such as file management, startup,
	        shutdown, and configuration handling divert attention
	        from the application itself.  If a mechanism existed
	        to ensure that the program never exited, the need for
	        this functionality is sharply reduced.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    An error by a single wayward programmer (malicious or not)
	    can therefore cause the entirety of the system to fail in
	    the field.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Problems that appear in the field are often the result of
	    a small error in one system propagating into another.
	    These include both errors in computation (such as the one
	    that caused the Arianne satellite launch self-destruct a
	    few years ago) and errors in pointer handling (which are
	    truly difficult to pin down).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To catch these errors, <em>boundaries</em> are needed.
	    Boundaries between functionally distinct components,
	    boundaries between independent units of failure,
	    boundaries for security, and boundaries between common and
	    exceptional cases.  Only if these boundaries exist can the
	    components be separately tested, upgraded, restarted, and
	    fault-comtained.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    EROS provides an application development platform that
	    allows the boundaries to be imposed, maintained, and
	    verified, without compromising performance.  The key
	    enabling technologies for building such applications are
	    persistence, capabilities, and a fast mechanism for
	    crossing protection boundaries.
	  </p>
	  <h1>3. Decomposing the Application</h1>
	  <p>
	    Boundaries can be introduced by decomposing the
	    application into independent components, each surrounded
	    by a protection boundary.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <img src="eros-app.gif" align=right>
	    By dividing the functionality of the application into
	    separate components (right), the performance and
	    reliability of the system is improved.  Each component can
	    concentrate on a particular, well-defined task, and
	    different components can run in parallel on multiprocessor
	    systems.  Components that run more often, such as
	    time-critical tasks and common-case computations, are
	    easily replicated.  Every component runs independent of
	    the others, and communicates only through well-specified
	    interfaces.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A common objection to decomposed designs is that crossing
	    process boundaries is expensive. Breaking a system into
	    many processes should therefore make the system slower.
	    While this is true, our experience shows that the overhead
	    is balanced by the simplification in the components
	    themselves.  In a complex system, eliminating the need for
	    explicit concurrency management alone makes up for the
	    extra process overheads.  In the end, we find that the
	    applications are often faster when structured this way
	    than they were in the monolithic design, and significantly
	    more reliable.  As we will see below, there are other
	    benefits to component-oriented design.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Persistence (discussed below) is a key enabling technology
	    for building applications in this way.  When an
	    application is made up of hundreds of protected
	    components, it is not feasible to reconstruct these
	    components each time the system restarts.  EROS's
	    persistence technology transparently preserves these
	    relationships across system restarts.
	  </p>
	  <h1>4. A Platform for Reliable Applications</h1>
	  <p>
	    A platform for reliable applications must support several
	    practices:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It must facilitate the construction of systems out of
		secure, protected components.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It must provide a means to give components the
		authority they need to do their tasks, and
		<em>only</em> that authority.
		At the same time, it must allow components
		to be built out of smaller components, which requires
		access delegation.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It must provide a high-performance mechanism for
		communication between these components.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    EROS supports these practices through persistence,
	    capabilities, and exceptionally fast protection boundary
	    crossing.
	  </p>
	  <h2>4.1 Persistence</h2>
	  <p>
	    The first key technology in EROS is <b>persistence</b>.
	    Every five minutes, the complete state of an EROS system
	    is saved.  If you trip over the power cord and restart the 
	    system, all of your programs will be restored.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In most operating systems, applications die when the
	    system crashes.  Any information that the application has
	    not explicitly saved is lost.  As a result,
	    high-availability applications spend a great deal of their
	    code dealing with restarting the application after a
	    failure and making sure that all of the necessary
	    information has been written down in the correct order.
	    The UNIX system, for example, can take anywhere from 2
	    minutes to several hours performing recovery after a
	    crash, depending on how many disks are attached to the
	    machine.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As complex as restarting one process is, restarting tens
	    or hundreds of processes and getting them all
	    communicating is much more difficult.  Because of this,
	    applications are not commonly divided into protected
	    components.  The underlying operating system technology
	    does not facilitate the creation and enforcement of these
	    boundaries.
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.1.1 Checkpointing</h3>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, programs do not die until they are told to.  Once
	    an application is started, it will continue to run until
	    it is dismantled -- even across system crashes.  Equally
	    important, if 2 or 3 or more processes are communicating,
	    they all come back from a crash with the same view of the
	    world -- there is no need to re-establish consistency.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is accomplished through a technique called
	    <em>checkpointing</em>.  Every so often, EROS halts
	    everything that is happening and arranges to write down
	    the entire state of every process on the machine.  The
	    checkpoint creates a consistent snapshot of everything
	    that is going on and then writes this shapshot down.  The
	    snapshot process is efficient; taking a snapshot requires
	    100ms every 5 minutes in the current system, and this will be
	    lowered in future versions.  Once the snapshot has been
	    taken, applications continue execution while the operating
	    system writes the snapshot down.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For applications that require more frequent stabilization,
	    such as databases, EROS provides a <em>journaling</em>
	    mechanism that allows data to be saved more frequently.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because checkpointing creates a consistent snapshot,
	    system recovery is fast.  When the power cord is
	    reinserted in the outlet, EROS is up and running in 30
	    seconds or less, with all applications intact.
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.1.2 Implications of Checkpointing</h3>
	  <p>
	    Checkpointing means that many applications do not need to
	    write data down to a file.  Because the application does
	    not die, there is no need to store the information
	    someplace else.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because all processes are checkpointed at the same time,
	    and are restored with a consistent idea of what is going
	    on, it is possible to build systems involving many
	    processes.  In EROS, an application such as an editor may
	    have four or five associated ``helper'' processes.  These
	    helper processes are usually shared by a number of other
	    programs, and spend most of their time idle.
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.1.3 Performance</h3>
	  <p>
	    Checkpointing also gets better performance out of your
	    disk drive.  Because the checkpoint mechanism moves data
	    in bulk, the disk is able to accomplish more work as the
	    disk arm moves over the drive.  To put that in numbers,
	    disk writes in EROS are several times faster than they are 
	    in Windows or UNIX.
	  </p>
	  <h2>4.2 Capabilities</h2>
	  <p>
	    The second key technology in EROS is <b>capabilities</b>,
	    which provide the basic security and access control
	    mechanism of the system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A capability is a protected token that lets the
	    holder perform certain specific operations on a particular 
	    object.  
	    If, for example, you possess a read-only capability to a
	    password database manager, you can check if a
	    user-supplied password is correct, but you cannot add new
	    users to the system.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Possession of a capability is a necessary <em>and
	    sufficient</em> condition for doing those operations on
	    that object.  If you have the capability, you can do what
	    it authorizes you to do on some object.  If you do not
	    have an appropriate capability, you cannot even tell if
	    that object exists.  If one component cannot access
	    another component, it cannot influence that component (for
	    good <em>or</em> for ill).  This means that faults cannot
	    propagate from one component to another if the components
	    are properly isolated.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, processes hold capabilities on behalf of their
	    users.  Contrast this with the situation in UNIX and
	    Microsoft Windows.  Every program has the authority to go
	    to the file system and attempt to create, remove, open,
	    read, and write the files that exist there.  Protection is
	    based on the identity of the user running the program,
	    rather than on what the program has been authorized to
	    do.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Think of it this way: you wouldn't hand your credit card
	    to an irresponsible teenager; it's more responsibility
	    than the teenager can handle.  For exactly the same
	    reasons, you shouldn't hand all of your access rights to a
	    process.  EROS lets you delegate authority in specific,
	    controlled increments.  UNIX and Microsoft Windows do
	    not.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Furthermore, capability systems let you hand out access
	    while imposing <em>controls</em> on that access.  This
	    enables the software designer to ensure information
	    <em>integrity</em> as well as information
	    <em>security</em>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Let's look at some examples.
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.2.1 Access Control And Integrity Checks</h3>
	  <p>
	    Suppose you have a valuable database that you do not want
	    me to copy.  You have sold me the right to run some fixed
	    number of queries on this database, and you want to make
	    sure that I won't run more than that without paying you
	    more money.  In order to run queries, I must have access
	    to the database.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <img src="mediator.gif" align=right>
	    In conventional systems, this problem is hard to solve.
	    In a capability system, it is trivial (right).  You simply
	    interpose a mediator between me and the database engine.
	    The mediator maintains a counter, and when the count has
	    been exhausted it refuses to process more queries.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In this picture, the mediator has access to the database,
	    but the user does not.  Because the user does not have
	    access to the program or data of the mediator, they cannot 
	    compromise security.  Your interests are protected by
	    virtue of the fact that you control what the mediator
	    does, and can therefore trust it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition to access control, mediators can provide
	    integrity checks to make sure that the queries make
	    sense (verifying, for example, that all fields are
	    properly filled out and that all necessary preconditions
	    have been met).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    With care, it is possible to inject a mediator module into
	    a client/server interaction <em>after the fact</em>.  The
	    server is temporarily halted and a new process is built to
	    act as the server.  The old server process (to which the
	    clients hold capabilities) is now made to run the mediator
	    program, and to call the old server when the queries are
	    acceptable.  This can be accomplished with no client
	    realizing that it has happened, provided that sufficient
	    access to the server is retained by some managing program.
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.2.2 Confinement</h3>
	  <p>
	    Suppose instead that the <em>client</em> has the valuable
	    database, and you have invented some essential algorithm
	    that they need to run.  You do not wish them to see the
	    code for the algorithm, and they do not wish to disclose
	    the database to you.  How are you to collaborate?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If the algorithm can be placed in a box so that it cannot
	    talk to you, the client can safely hand it their data.
	    You, on the other hand, are protected by the fact that the
	    client cannot examine the code or access rights of your
	    application (just like in the mediator case above).  The
	    problem is to have some agent you trust who will certify
	    to the client that your program is ``safe.''
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is <em>impossible</em> to accomplish in a
	    conventional system, but fairly simple in a capability
	    design.  The trusted party is known as a
	    <b>constructor</b> (right).  <img src="constructor.gif"
	    align=right> The constructor is a system-provided program
	    that knows how to start programs.  You first install your
	    program in a constructor object, telling it all of the
	    capabilities that the program will directly use.  You hand
	    this newly populated constructor to the client.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The client now asks the constructor ``If I run this
	    program, is it safe?'' (1).  Based on the capabilities
	    that your program holds, the constructor is able to say
	    ``yes'' or ``no.''  The client can then decide whether or
	    not to run your program.  If so, it requests that a
	    new copy of the program be fabricated (2).  The
	    constructor fabricates a copy (3), and returns a
	    capability to it to the client.  After this, the client and the
	    application can communicate freely (4).
	  </p>
	  <h3>4.2.3 Non-Privileged Administration</h3>
	  <p>
	    Account administration is an ongoing problem in large
	    organizations.  On the one hand, it should be easy to
	    create accounts for new employees.  On the other, it is
	    highly desirable to limit the damage that can be done by
	    any single person.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Suppose, for example, that we wish to allow any manager to 
	    create a new account for their direct reports, and allow
	    anyone in their management chain to lock the account
	    (prohibiting logins) in an emergency.  Also, if two
	    consecutive people in the management tree agree, the
	    account should be easily deleted.  Finally, there are a
	    small number of people who should be able to do tasks by
	    fiat.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a capability system, implementing such a policy is not
	    difficult.  It can be accomplished by placing a mediator
	    in front of the standard password management process, and
	    giving most managers access to the mediator.  Those
	    managers who are authorized to fire people summarily are
	    <em>in addition</em> given access to the real password
	    manager.  The reason this access is in addition is to
	    prevent mistakes -- if the upper level manager can operate
	    normally in the carefully checked environment, there is
	    less risk that they will do something irrevocable that
	    would have been possible using the more powerful tool
	    (such as deleting the wrong account).
	  </p>
	  <h2>4.3 Crossing Protection Boundaries</h2>
	  <p>
	    The EROS approach to reliability divides applications into
	    many protected components.  Each component provides a
	    well-defined function, and each completely embodies some
	    piece of functionality. If the performance of an
	    algorithm is critical, it is implemented entirely within a
	    single protected component.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The end result is that while protection boundaries must be
	    crossed in a decomposed application, they are not crossed
	    in the performance-critical portions of the code.  Based
	    on experience with a number of applications ranging from
	    database systems to network protocol processing, we have
	    determined that the protected call operation should be
	    within a factor of 10 of the cost of procedure calls.
	    This is the point where most component oriented designs
	    fail.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    On Pentium family processors, EROS's current protected
	    call mechanism takes 2.45 microseconds, or roughly 294
	    cycles, as compared to 25 to 35 cycles for a typical
	    procedure call (including argument handling).  This is
	    more than fast enough to allow applications to be
	    decomposed successfully.  Work that is currently in
	    progress will further reduce this to roughly 170 cycles on
	    the Pentium family.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Of this 294 cycles, Over 100 cycles are spent dealing with
	    issues that are peculiar to the Intel architecture.  A
	    RISC implementation would therefore provide protected
	    transfers in the 70 to 160 cycle range.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Previous component systems have had protected crossing
	    mechanisms that are 100 to 1000 times slower than EROS.
	    Because this cost may be applied in several places in an
	    application, its impact is hard to assess without building
	    the application in the new style.  Beyond raw speed, two
	    factors reduce the performance impact of protection
	    boundary crossing in EROS still further:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p> 
		Every EROS component is a mutual exclusion zone,
		which eliminates the need for slow, complex, and error 
		prone locking disciplines in many cases.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p> 
		Dividing the application into multiple pieces
		facilitates parallel processing -- even in primarily
		serial applications.  Further, it makes it easier to
		identify and tune the critical components of the
		application.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    EROS performance is discussed in quantitative terms below.
	  </p>
	  <h1>5. Solutions for Large Systems</h1>
	  <p>
	    Having introduced some of the key technologies in EROS, we 
	    now turn to how these technologies are applied.  What good 
	    are they, and how do they help build reliable systems.
	  </p>
	  <h1>5.1 Making Unit Tests Cost-Effective</h1>
	  <p>
	    Unit testing is the practice of testing each component in
	    isolation before combining it with the other components in
	    a system.  Using current engineering disciplines and
	    operating environments, unit testing is expensive -- so
	    much so that many application developers have abandoned
	    the practice altogether.  There are basically two reasons
	    for this:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Module specifications are not enforcable.  Modern
		programming languages leave the data structures and
		internal functions of a module exposed to other
		modules, and whatever is exposed will be used by
		someone in a hurry.  These seemingly innocent
		cross-dependencies become an ongoing nightmare for
		testing.  They ensure that test suites rapidly become
		outdated.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The EROS component design exposes nothing but the
		specified interfaces, which prevents this problem.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Unit boundaries are not preserved when the modules
		are combined into a final application.  Once combined,
		the modules no longer operate in isolation, and tests
		based on an assumption of isolation are therefore
		weakened.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Suppose that for every module you manage to locate 95%
		of the bugs that will occur in the first 6 months in
		the field.  After assembling 20 or 30 modules into an
		application, you will certainly see a failure in at
		least one module in the first six months.  The failure
		will be subtle -- if not, your unit tests will have
		found it.  Worse, it is highly likely to involve
		interactions that cross module boundaries.  Such
		interactions, by definition, cannot be caught by unit
		testing.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The EROS component approach preserves protection
		boundaries between modules in the final application.
		These boundaries will not stop the errors from
		occuring, but they do enable them to be caught earlier
		and ensure that cross-module effects cannot occur.
		This substantially reduces the likelihood of
		data-corrupting errors.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    When an EROS component breaks, the state of the component
	    can be preserved for later inspection, making it much
	    easier to determine what went wrong.
	  </p>
	  <h1>5.2 Field-Replaceable Software Units</h1>
	  <p>
	    A basic idea in the EROS approach to reliable platforms is
	    <em>field replaceable software units</em>.  You have
	    delivered a system into the field and are preparing to
	    deploy a performance or functional enhancement.  Many
	    modules will be replaced, but there are limits to how much 
	    testing is cost effective.  How can you be sure you are
	    ready?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <img src="frsu.gif" align=right> With EROS's
	    field-replaceable software units (FRSU), you can actually
	    deploy the new software into the field and test it there
	    <em>without</em> breaking a single client application.
	    The figure at right shows an application with the current
	    and new component running simultaneously.  The
	    verification module makes all requests of <em>both</em>
	    the current and the new version of the component.  If the
	    answers disagree, the verifier records this fact and the
	    request that caused the discrepancy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The verifier is completely generic.  While it is possible
	    to build verifiers that will permit certain differences in 
	    the output, or will allow more sophisticated comparison,
	    the basic verification mechanism does not need to be
	    customized to any particular component.  The client is
	    unaware that a verifier has been inserted, and will see
	    the answers that it is expecting, because they are
	    provided by the original component.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The advantage to this mechanism is that the new component
	    can be tested <em>in situ</em>, where input arrives that
	    has nothing to do with cleanly designed and considered
	    test cases.  The verifier therefore serves as the last and 
	    least costly means of testing the behavior of a component
	    in the field, and simultaneously provides the feedback
	    necessary to update the test suite.
	  </p>
	  <h1>6. The Cost of Protection</h1>
	  <p>
	    Obviously, the protection and reliability features that
	    EROS provides are valuable.  But what do they cost?  How
	    much impact does this approach have on the software design 
	    process, and what is the performance cost of the
	    protection that EROS provides?
	  </p>
	  <h2>6.1 POSIX Compatibility</h2>
	  <p>
	    EROS is not a POSIX-compliant system, and many potential
	    customers are concerned about what this means for
	    portability and compatibility.  If an application is built 
	    to run on EROS, how much of it will need to be thrown away 
	    to go to some other environment?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    No matter which environment you go to, POSIX compatibility
	    is not available.  No current reliable or real-time system
	    provider provides a POSIX-compatible environment.  QNX,
	    Lynx, and other real-time system providers provide
	    POSIX-compatible development environments (as EROS will),
	    but <em>the real-time environment is not POSIX
	    compatible.</em> Tandem, similarly, provides a
	    POSIX-compliant application environment, but applications
	    running in this environment do not get the benefits of
	    their reliable application technologies.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As software
	    engineers, our observation is that the difficulty in
	    porting an application usually lies in two areas:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The application itself is not well modularized, with
		the result that its operating system dependencies are
		not well-isolated.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The resource and support requirements of the
		applications are therefore unclear, and are difficult
		to extract after the fact.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Differences in the underlying operating system are
	    generally <em>not</em> the basic source of difficulty in
	    porting.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We have found that the EROS component design style results
	    in a natural, well-structured, manageably complex
	    application.  This ensures that the application is well
	    modularized, and that the system and resource dependencies
	    are easily identified.  Applications written for EROS are
	    therefore relatively easy to port to other environments,
	    and continue to benefit from their EROS origins in terms
	    of ongoing reliability and maintainability.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This means that <em>the risk associated with porting an
	    application to EROS is small.</em> In the worst event, the
	    application comes out with a better and more modular
	    architecture that can be leveraged on existing platforms.
<!-- 	    Shibui's consulting engineers are experienced with both -->
<!-- 	    EROS and other systems, and can help guide the development -->
<!-- 	    process so as to minimize the risk of porting to EROS. -->
	  </p>
	  <h2>6.2 Performance Impact</h2>
	  <p>
	    EROS applications are generally <em>faster</em> than their
	    non-component counterparts.  In addition, they are more
	    predictable, which makes them more readily able to adapt
	    to changes in application load.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Measurements of the EROS interprocess communication
	    mechanisms show that it is nearly 10 times faster than the
	    fastest interprocess communications mechanisms available
	    on UNIX or Windows-NT.  Microsoft, we note, has been
	    unable to make protected components work efficiently, and
	    for practical purposes has abandoned them in favor of
	    in-process controls.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    KeyKOS, the predecessor to EROS, supported a
	    binary-compatible UNIX environment that ran just as fast
	    as the native UNIX on the same platform.  This environment 
	    was the result of a quick six month port, and had not yet
	    been tuned.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    On the System/370, the KeyKOS database facilities
	    outperformed both IMS and DB/2.  In fact, the first
	    commercial deployment of the KeyKOS system was for online
	    processing of VISA transactions, in which application the
	    system demonstrated a 3 year mean time to failure in the
	    field.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    EROS is a new system, and there is not yet a great deal of
	    experience with this implementation in the field.  What we
	    know is this: it is faster than KeyKOS, which was faster
	    and more reliable than anything else.
	  </p>
	  <h1>7. Summary</h1>
	  <p>
	    EROS provides a rich environment for constructing secure,
	    reliable applications.  It's unique features enable it to
	    support large, field-engineerable applications without
	    compromising either overall performance or responsiveness.
