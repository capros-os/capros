	    <P>
	      I've begun a set of small, introductory essays on
	      various aspects of the EROS design.  These notes are
	      intended to be more explanatory than the <a
	      href="../design-notes/00DesignNotes.html">design
	      notes</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Norm Hardy has also written a number of essays, which
	      you can find <a
	      href="http://www.cap-lore.com/index.html">here</a>.
	      Norm's tend more toward pondering of serious issues in
	      capability systems and security, while these notes tend
	      to be more introductory in nature.
	    </p>
	    <H1>Introductory Material</h1>
	    <p>
	      These essays are intended for a beginning audience.
	      Their purpose is to define terms or explain concepts so
	      that people can join the discussion on capability
	      security and capability systems.
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  <a href="capintro.html">What <i>is</i> a Capability,
		    Anyway?</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Provides a layman's introduction to capabilities,
		  describing what they are, what they do, and why they
		  result in better security than today's computer
		  systems.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  <a href="wherefrom.html">Where Capabilities Come
		    From</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		  One source of confusion about capability systems is
		  where capabilities come from. How does my program
		  get one?  Where does the system get them from?  This
		  note tries to answer such questions.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p> 
		  <a href="reliability/paper.html">EROS: A Platform
		    for Reliable Applications</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Describes why EROS provides a better platform for
		  building reliable applications than POSIX-based
		  systems.  Identifies some of the reasons that
		  EROS-based applications tend to be both more
		  reliable and more testable than their POSIX
		  equivalents.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <H1>Notes on Specific Issues</h1>
	    <p>
	      These essays address some specific topics about the
	      design of the EROS system, often with an eye toward
	      explaining why EROS is structured in a particular way.
	      My hope is that documenting these thoughts will make it
	      easier to translate these ideas to other systems, or
	      make it clear why such translation is difficult.
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  <a href="Persistence.html">Persistence</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Explains why EROS uses transparent checkpointing as
		  its basic approach to persistence, and what issues
		  are raised by this choice.  This note also discusses
		  some of the implications of this choice for the
		  structure of the operating system, which may be
		  helpful to people contemplating persistence designs
		  for other systems.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <a href="ACLSvCaps.html">Comparing ACLs and Capabiliies</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Many people seem to think that capabilities and
		  access control lists are simply two ways of looking
		  at the same thing. They are not. This note 
		  provides a description of how capabilities and
		  access control lists actually work, and why the two
		  are <em>not</em> equivalent.

		  One of the classic papers on the entire subject of
		  protection.
