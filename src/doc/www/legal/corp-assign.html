	    The EROS Group has developed certain operating
	    system software and related utilities and applications
	    which, together with past and future changes, additions,
	    and contributions thereto are known as the EROS System
	    ("EROS System").
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Contributor owns and has sufficient rights to
	    contribute certain software source code and other related
	    intellectual property (collectively, the
	    "Contribution").
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Contributor agrees to the following:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor hereby assigns to The EROS Group
		all worldwide common law and statutory rights
		associated with the copyrights, copyright
		application, copyright registration and moral rights
		in the Contribution.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		To the extent that there may exist patent claims
		licensable by Contributor that would be necessarily
		infringed by the use or redistribution of the
		Contribution either alone or when combined with the
		EROS System ("Licensable Patents"),
		Contributor hereby grants <b>to all recipients of
		  the EROS System</b>
		a non-exclusive, worldwide,
		royalty-free  license to the Licensable
		Patents, if any,
		to make, use, sell, offer to
		sell, import and otherwise transfer or sublicense
		the Contribution in source code and object code
		form.		
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This patent
		license shall apply to the combination of the
		Contribution and the EROS System as it exists at the
		time of Contribution if, at the time the
		Contribution is contributed by the Contributor,
		addition of the Contribution to the EROS System causes such
		combination to be covered by the Licensable
		Patents.
	      </p> 
	      <p>
		This patent license shall further apply to
		any version of the EROS System that is redistributed
		by Contributor, whether or not such version
		incorporates Contributions from Contributor.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor represents that he/she/it is legally
		entitled to grant the above assignment and license
		and that the Contribution itself and Contributor's
		grants under this contribution do not violate any
		law or regulation or breach any contract.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor agrees to take such reasonable actions
		as may be required, if any, to perfect the
		assignment of the Contribution as stated herein,
		including the execution and delivery of any
		additional instruments of assignment if appropriate
		and necessary.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor agrees that this assignment is in effect
		for all Contributions of software source code and
		other related intellectual property made by
		Contributor (now or in the future) while this
		agreement is in force, unless other provisions have
		been made between the Contributor and The EROS
		Group for a particular Contribution or category of
		Contribution. 
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor agrees that any transmission of a
		Contribution to The EROS Group while this agreement
		is in force shall be considered a Contribution under
		this agreement. Such transmissions include, but are
		not limited to (a) transmission by electronic mail,
		(b) publication of such code on an electronic
		mailing list maintained by The EROS Group for the
		purpose of EROS-related discussions and exchanges,
		and (c) addition or modification of The EROS System
		by committing changes into the source code
		repository for the EROS system using the
		then-current configuration management tools.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It is not the purpose of this agreement to deprive a
		Contributor of the ability to make other use of
		their own work. Therefore, The EROS Group grants an
		unrestricted license to Contributor to make any
		desired use whatsoever of their Contribution,
		including redistribution of the Contribution by the
		Contributor under any terms that the Contributor may
		choose. However, The EROS Group provides this
		license on a purely "as-is" basis. Contributor
		assumes all liability for the consequences of such
		use by Contributor.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Contributor acknowledges that the incorporation
		of the Contribution into the EROS System inherently
		constitutes good and valuable consideration to
		Contributor.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		This agreement may be terminated by either
		Contributor or The EROS Group at any time by giving
		14 days notice in writing to the other party. If
		terminated, all of the terms of this agreement will
		remain in force for contributions made prior to the
		date of termination.
