	      EROS is currently

	      (GPL) and the <a href="license/LGPL.html">GNU Lesser
	      General Public License</a> (LGPL). The general rule for

	      In order to ensure that Core EROS remains open, and to
	      ensure that we are able to provide security assurance
	      for EROS in the future, we require that modifications
	      and enhancements to Core EROS be assigned to The EROS
	      Group.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As we include more and more application function, the
	      distribution will come to include materials covered
	      under other open source licenses such as the BSD
	      license, the X Consortium License, and/or the Apache
	      License.
	    </p>
	    <H1>Why GPL?</h1>
	    <p>
	      The obvious reason to use GPL is that it is widely used
	      and there is wide agreement about what it means. Also,
	      there is a large amount of code covered by GPL that we
	      might wish to incorporate into the EROS system. In spite
	      of some very bad problems, these are the reasons that we
	      use GPL. So what are the problems?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      GPL is horribly ambiguous, and it is missing some very
	      important protections for <em>everyone</em> about
	      patents. GPL does not adequately define what a
	      ``combined work'' is, and these are very difficult
	      things to define in modern systems. For example, there
	      has been a long debate about whether dynamically linking
	      an extension into a GPL application requires the
	      extension to be distributed under GPL. The Free Software
	      Foundation says "yes." The Linux community (and many
	      others) say "no."
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The ``combined work'' problem is especially bad for
	      systems like EROS. In EROS, applications are typically
	      built out of components. Each of these components is a
	      completely separate program that invokes other
	      components using capabilities. When two components are a
	      ``combined work,'' and one is distributed under GPL,
	      they must both be distributed under GPL. The question
	      is: when are two components considered a ``combined
	      work?''
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Because of this ambiguity, we are periodically asked to
	      consider changing the license terms. The two most common
	      reason for this request are:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Somebody wishes to use some propretary piece of
		  hardware, and does not wish to disclose the code for
		  the driver.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We don't think that there are compelling
		  <em>economic</em> reasons to avoid proprietary
		  drivers, and we think that in the end this approach
		  to hardware is doomed, but we do not want to stall
		  the progress of EROS while people figure this
		  out. There is a great deal of value to all of us in
		  having EROS widely deployed.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Somebody has some piece of valuable proprietary
		  software that they wish to distribute with an EROS
		  system, and they cannot determine if they are
		  obligated to distribute this code under GPL.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We encourage people to consider whether it might be
		  better to open their software, but this is not an
		  unreasonable question and it deserves a clear
		  answer.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      So the question is: how does the license apply to
	      EROS?
	    </p>
	    <H1>What MUST be Opened</h1>
	    <p>
	      If you modify an existing piece of code, creating a
	      derived work, you must license the derived work
	      under GPL.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you modify an existing EROS program in such a way
	      that it depends on or makes use of some other program,
	      then the two programs together <em>may</em> be a
	      combined work. If they are a combined work, then both
	      programs must be released under GPL.  Here are the
	      guidelines that determine whether two components
	      (programs) are a combined work:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <b>Inseparable Components.</b>
		  If neither component has a reasonable and useful
		  function when taken in isolation, the two
		  programs are a combined work.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <b>Separable Components.</b>
		  If one of the components has reasonable and
		  useful function in isolation, but is not
		  installed in such a way that it can be used by a
		  third party developer, then the components are a
		  combined work.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <b>Security Dependency.</b>
		  If component A is claimed to provide security
		  guarantees, and depends on component B to
		  satisfy its security guarantees, then the two
		  components are a combined work <em>unless</em>:
		</p>
		<ol type="A">
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      Component B is a separable component whose
		      source code is available to the user under
		      an open source license, or
		    </p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      Component B is a separable component that has
		      been certified under the ITSEC or Common
		      Criteria process to meet all requirements that
		      are necessary to support the security claims
		      made about A, or
		    </p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>
		      The party installing the system may easily omit
		      or replace component B without rendering
		      component A or the system as a whole
		      non-functional.
		    </p>
		  </li>
		</ol>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <b>Interfaces.</b> Interface stubs and header files
		  that must be incorporated into a program in order to
		  <em>use</em> some other program must be opened
		  <em>under LGPL or a similarly permissive
		  license</em> in order to be incorporated into the
		  EROS repository. By ``similarly permissive,'' we
		  mean that the mere linking of interface code into a
		  program should <em>not</em> require that program to
		  be published under any particular open source
		  license.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  <b>Documentation.</b> Documentation for open
		  components should be openly redistributable.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      <u>These guidelines are subject to change</u>, because
	      we have probably missed something important and it is
	      impossible to anticipate the questions that people will
	      raise in the future. Revisions will be made for the
	      purpose of clarification and to address unforseen
	      situations. Revisions will <em>not</em> be made for the
	      purpose of subverting the ability to create proprietary
	      software that runs on EROS.
	    </p>
	    <H1>What SHOULD be Opened</h1>
	    <p>
	      Above and beyond what <em>must</em> be opened, there
	      are some things that <em>should</em> be opened:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  If equivalent function is provided by an existing
		  open source application, then the new program should
		  be distributed as open source.
		</p>
		<p>
		  These programs should be opened because we all want
		  the EROS system to remain competative with other
		  systems.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  If the security of the system critically depends on
		  the new program or component, it should be
		  distributed as open source.
		</p>
		<p>
		  These programs should be opened because security is
		  a major advantage of EROS, and it will be trusted
		  only if people can see for themselves that the
		  system is secure. You may say it's secure, and I may
		  say it's secure, but when an independent party can
		  examine the software to see if it's secure the users
		  are much more confident that we are telling the truth.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <H1>What NEED NOT be Opened</h1>
	    <p>
	      Unless the resulting program is a derived or combined
	      work as described above, there is no <em>obligation</em>
	      to release it as open source at all, and there is
	      certainly no obligation to release it under GPL.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Proprietary Drivers</h2>
	    <p>
	      Proprietary drivers are a commonly raised concern. We
	      believe that they are misguided: a driver is too easily
	      reverse engineered, and there is rarely any benefit to
	      <em>preventing</em> people from using your
	      hardware. There is <em>no</em> security achieved by
	      keeping a driver proprietary.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you are really determined to do this, however, here
	      is one way to go about it:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Create a minimal, generic open source driver that
		  knows <em>how</em> to speak to your hardware, but
		  does not know what to say. This will expose the
		  addresses of the hardware registers and memory, but
		  will not expose how to use them. It will also expose
		  a minimal amount of demultiplexing logic for
		  interrupts.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Expose this driver via a capability interface.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Write the real driver as an application program that
		  uses this interface.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      We are planning to include in the kernel a "generic"
	      driver intended for testing and debugging purposes, but
	      this generic driver could probably be used as a basis
	      for proprietary drivers.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Proprietary Input Methods</h2>
	    <p>
	      Some companies have proprietary input devices or
	      proprietary code that interprets these input
	      devices. This code does not need to be made open
	      if it can be left out of the system by the user and
	      still have a functional system or if it can be replaced
	      by the user.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The main problem with this type of code from our
	      perspective is the fact that the security of the system
	      relies completely on the correctness of this code, and a
	      trusted system should not be built on code that cannot
	      be independently analyzed and verified by the user.
