    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>
      An Application Service Provider (ASP) is an operator of
      computational facilities for contract customers, possibly
      provided on a rented or leased basis. ASPs are distinguished
      from conventional outsourcing operations by the fact that the
      software running on the rented/leased resources is at least
      partially dictated by the customer. That is, the operating basis
      for such systems is that the customer has paid for a standard
      arrangement of tools provided by the operator and may optionally
      augment those tools with software provided by the customer, a
      third party, or some combination thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operational requirements for an ASP include as subset cases:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Small-business servers, in which the operator is an agent of
	  the user,
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Large-business servers, in which the operator is an agent of
	  the company that owns the equipment, but may not be entitled
	  to access the content of any particular user,
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Premises equipment in which the operator is a provider of
	  some data-oriented service. This scenario has two further
	  subcases:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Content delivery devices (including set top boxes) (such
	      as multimedia content) in which the user is not
	      generally offered the option to install software, or in
	      which the enablement of available user options is
	      accomplished through the intervention of the operator.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Enhanced premises devices (such as connected gaming
	      devices), in which either the user may cause the
	      installation of new applications and/or services that
	      the user can subsequently cause to run.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Handheld devices, in which the user is the operator, not all
	  software is equally trusted, and the users wishe to protect
	  sensitive or valuable information from software that later
	  proves to be malicious, faulty, or both.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The common, characterizing attribute of these applications is
      that the computing platform is expected to run hostile software
      without being compromised or substantially degraded in
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ASP Operating System (ASP OS) is an operating system capable
      of supporting the application service provider application and
      its subsets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stakeholders in an ASP OS fall into several categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The <em>operator</em>, who must meet obligations of specific
	  performance to parties who have rented/leased service on a
	  given compute platform. Simultaneously, the operator may
	  wish for legal reasons to be distanced from liability
	  resulting from the actions of users and/or developers. This
	  requires that the ASP OS enforce certain types of
	  separations between these stakeholders.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The <em>user</em>, who has some application set they wish to
	  run using the compute platform; presumably, but not
	  necessarily, for the purpose of accomplishing some external
	  goal.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <em>Developers</em> of software components and services
	  installed by users or operators, who have warranties or
	  contractual obligations that must be satisfied (contingent
	  on operators, users, installers, and supplier developers
	  meeting required preconditions). In addition to obligations
	  of specific performance, a developer may optionally embody
	  within their program content and algorithms that are
	  proprietary, and therefore should not be disclosed to the
	  user(s) of the system.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The <em>installer</em>, who configures the operating system
	  on specific target hardware and potentially ensures that
	  applicable tamper-proofing requirements are satisfied. The
	  installer must inherently be trusted by the other parties.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The <em>system architect</em>, who architects, designs, and
	  implements the ASP OS and its core runtime environment, and
	  is inherently trusted by the other parties.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is beyond the scope of this protection profile to specify
      means by which a secure bootstrap of the TOE is achieved prior
      to the execution of the first instruction of the TOE.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is beyond the scope of this protection profile to specify how
      a developer may remotely determine whether the critical hardware
      tamper-proofing function of the installer has been
      satisfactorily met in the deployment of the TOE. This will
      eventually be the subject of a separate PP/ST combination.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Threats</h2>
    <p>
      There are three major attack categories to which an ASP OS is
      subject:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Escape: Attempts by hostile software that is executing on
	  the ASP OS to compromise their containment boundaries for
	  the purpose of unauthorized disclosure.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Exhaustion: Attempts to exhaust resources in order to impose
	  starvation on other applications.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Penetration: Attempts to bypass the normal mediation of
	  software introduction in order to evade the security
	  policies of the ASP OS. Alternatively, an attempt to
	  compromise some element of the TSF.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </pp.toedescrip>
  <pp.securityenvironment>
    <p>
      The following paragraphs explain in greater detail the Security
      Environment in which the ASP OS is expected to operate.

	      The TOE operates from a finite pool of resources. It
	      allocates and mediates access to these resources, but
	      neither creates nor destroys them. The correctness of
	      the TOE's execution must not rely on the assumption that
	      available resources are unbounded.

	  </pp.description>
	  <pp.notes>
	    <p>
	      Such detection violates confinement. There is a need for
	      the operator to be able to observe aggregate conditions
	      on the machine. For example, the operator needs to be
	      able to learn both both (a) total available space with
	      which to create accounts, and (b) amount of space
	      currently under the control of a given user. The
	      administrator should <em>not</em> be able to learn in
	      any fine grain way the fraction of authorized space that
	      has been allocated.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Analogous issues arise with most security detection
	      mechanisms. In general, the objective of this PP is to
	      close security holes by making improper actions
	      impossible <em>a priori</em> rather than providing
	      <em>post hoc</em> mechanisms for discovery.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A notable exception to this rule concerns the behavior
	      of events <em>outside</em> the scope of legitemate user
	      activity. For example, the system aggregate number of
	      packets sent and received, and any information
	      voluntarily logged by the networking subsystem with the
