<IMG src="../img/construction.gif" align=left>
<p> For some months now, we've been telling people that we would have
a research release of the EROS system sometime in 4Q98.  This is still
on target.  What follows are details on compatibility for the first
research release and some notes on what remains to be done for that
release.  Our trusty software elves are working hard to get all this
ready.
<H1>1. First Research Release</H1>
<p> The first research release is intended for people who enjoy
living on the bleeding edge.  It provides a feature-minimal x86
baseline system.  Less suicidal users may wish to delay until the
<a href="#rel2">second</a> or <a href="#rel3">third</a> research release.
<h2>1.1 To-Do List</h2>
<p> The following is a partial list of the major to-do items that need
to be completed before the first research release can go out.
Completed items have their circles solidified, so check back now and
then if you're interested in how things are progressing.
<ul>
  <li type=filled> Rewrite the space bank to hand back recently
       deallocated space to avoid unnecessary disk accesses.  Augment
       the current space bank to handle multiple ranges.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Enhance VCSK/FSK to batch space purchase and
       remember last fault so as to improve performance of temporary
       heap storage allocation.
       <p> 
  <li type=filled> Locate and fix the lurking checkpoint accounting
       bug.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Apply the fix for the 100 Mbit network performance
       problem.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Test the line-discipline code so we can use it for
       the disk formatter.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Implement a formatting (and eventually,
       partitioning) utility for use in installation.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> See if we can get a minimal TCP/IP stack running in
       addition to the router support.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Write and document some example programs.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Document the invocation stub libraries.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Finalize the copyright and licensing terms for the
       research releases.
       <p> 
</ul>
<h2>1.2 Disk Space</h2>
<p> The research release <em>can</em> run in as little as 20 Mbytes.
Doing anything interesting with it will certainly require more.  At
the moment we are suggesting a 100 Mbyte partition if you just want to
fiddle with it, or a 250 Mbyte partition if you have something more
serious in mind.  We'll put together a note on space planning before
the release.
<p> If you feel like planning ahead, use your handy <code>fdisk</code>
equivalent to create a partition, and give it type 0x95.  To boot from
the hard disk, the EROS partition must fall within the bootable range
of your machine.  It is also possible (even straightforward) to boot
EROS from a floppy, which allows non-bootable partitions to be used.
The kernel theoretically groks extended partitions, but we have never
tested this.
<h2>1.3 Hardware Requirements</h2>
<p> The research release will support the following hardware (all
trademarks belong to their respective owners):

  <table width=85%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Processor</strong></td>
      <td>486, Pentium, Pentium Pro.  There's nothing we're aware of
	that would prevent clone processors from working, but we have
	no way to test them and they are not a priority for us. If you
	have them, we would be glad to hear what luck you have.  Up to
	a point, we'll try to help get them working.
	<p> EROS runs on all of the multiprocessor boards we have
	tried, but the first research release will not provide SMP
	support.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>BIOS</strong></td>
      <td>We are not aware of any BIOS-specific dependencies. We have
	not tested large drives on BIOS's that do not support extended
	drive size information.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td>
      <td>We are not aware of specific dependencies.  We use the TYAN
	family of motherboards, but have also run successfully on a
	number of clone boards.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Memory</strong></td>
      <td>We have run EROS successfully (albeit unintentionally) on a
	machine with only 640K of memory.  This is not a recommended
	configuration.  8M should be fine for now, but 16M is better.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Disk</strong></td>
      <td>The first research release will <em>not</em> support SCSI
	disks.  There are a great many SCSI controllers, and we have
	found that the <em>sustainable</em> throughput for IDE is as
	good or better than we see from SCSI.  We are aware that many
	people want to run SCSI devices.  
	<p> When we do get to SCSI (which should be soon -- it's
	necessary for the MIPS port we are doing), our first attention
	will go to the Adaptec 2940 family, because that is what we
	have.  Support for other adaptors will be guided by demand and
	availability.  Your chances of getting us to support a card
	are greatly improved if you have one to loan us.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Video</strong></td>
      <td> The kernel assumes a VGA or better adaptor, but the system
	does not (yet) provide a bitmapped graphics interface.
	<p> We hope to change this in the near future, but are still
	debating the proper graphics model for this class of system.
	The Mach32, Mach64, and Diamond cards are high on our priority
	list.  Our group favors the Toshiba portables, so we'll
	probably get the C&amp;T chipset family working early as well.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
      <td> The current implementation supports the 3COM 3c509 and
	3c590XL network cards.  Support for the SMC Ultra
	(tulip-based) card may or may not make it into the first
	research release.
      </td>
    </tr>

<h2>1.4 Software Requirements</h2>
<p> EROS does not yet have a self-hosted development environment.  We
are actively working on bringing up a POSIX-compatible environment,
but do not expect that this will make it into the first release.  The
irony is that we may get Java development support in first (!).
<p> The EROS group currently cross-develops from LINUX.  We run RedHat
4.0 (cutting over to 4.1 shortly), but any ELF-based LINUX system
should do.  Building the EROS system requires G++ 2.7.2 or later.
<p> One area that we are currently weak in is example programs.  We
will be making this a priority as the time for release draws nearer.
<h2>1.5 Caveats</h2>
<p> One of the late changes in the first research release was to the
IPC interface, and we are still transitioning objects to take
advantage of the new interface.  These interfaces WILL change in the
second release, and the change will require a relink. The best way to
cover yourself is to use the stub library wrappers.  We will
undoubtedly add new IPC wrappers, but the interface to the existing
wrapper functions should not change in the second research release.

<H1><a name="rel2">2. Second Research Release</H1>
<p> The second research release should provide both a more mature
foundation release and support for an additional platform: the MIPS
R4000.  This release is targeted for Q397, but we may slip it slightly
if doing so will let us get bitmapped graphics into this release.
<p> At a minimum, this release will include:
<ul>
  <li type=circle> Support for the MIPS R4000 processor
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> SCSI support for a limited number of adaptors.
       <p>
  <li type=circle> Java application support via a bytecode compiler,
       if that didn't make the first release.
       <p>
  <li type=circle> Bitmapped video support.
       <p>
</ul>
<H1><a name="rel3">3. Third Research Release</H1>
<p> The third research release is intented to provide a native
development environment and a real user interface.  No specific target
date is yet available for this release.
<p> The targeted enhancements for this release are:
<ul>
  <li type=circle> Login agent and session manager.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> POSIX-based self-hosted development environment.
       <p> 
  <li type=circle> Bitmapped graphics support.
       <p>
  <li type=circle> Performance Enhancements.
       <p> 
</ul>
<p> It is possible that the objectives for this release can be folded
into the second release, in which case we may slip the second release
date.
