<P> The EROS team is an eclectic bunch of folks who have worked on a
wide variety of previous projects.  Some of them are here at Penn,
while others are out in the real world.  The following descriptions
don't really do these folks justice.
<p> The stupid looking cupids are my way of convincing people that
they really ought to get me their photographs in a hurry.

	<em>Jonathan S. Shapiro</em>
	<p> The principle architect and project leader for the EROS
	system, Jonathan is a successful entrepreneur currently
	disguised as a doctoral candidate, and is a Senior Consultant
	with Synergistic Computing Associates.  He started the EROS
	project in late 1991 with Norm Hardy, and has been working at
	it off an on since then.  Jonathan is the originator of the
	kernel threads design, and the 'SNOCRASH distributed snapshot
	algorithm which is the underpinning of distributed orthogonal
	persistence.
	<p> Jonathan's prior work has been in the areas of computer
	architecture and CASE tools.  His <a

	information.

	<em>Jonathan Adams</em>
	<p> A sophomore at the California Institute of Technology,
	Jonathan has spent the summer of 1997 working on EROS at the
	University of Pennsylvania, where he built the current version
	of the space bank and line discipline components.  His
	interests include ditch day planning (A CALTECH tradition),
	physics, computing, electrical engineering, and the local
	wildlife.
	<p> Jonathan claims not to have a home page, and was smart
	enough not to let shap make one up for him.  When he joins the
	20th century he will let us know.

	critical role in design reviews, invariably taking positions
	that maximize her role in the proceedings. Sheena is an expert
	at locating and shedding unnecessary fluff, which tends to
	make the fur really fly.  Also, she has a knack for declaring
