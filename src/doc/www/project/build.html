	  <h1>1. Obtaining CapROS</h1>
	  <p>
	    If you just want to have a
	    look at the code, you can simply go to the 
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/capros/">
	    Project page</a>
            and click on "Browse CVS".
            SourceForge also has instructions for getting
            anonymous access to CVS. 
	  </p>
	  <h1>2. Building CapROS</h1>
	  <p>
          These instructions are for building for the Intel architecture.
          A port also exists for the ARM architecture; see
          <a href="#ARMBuild">below</a>. 
	  </p>
          <h2>2.1. Package Requirements</h2>
	  <p>
            CapROS is built using Linux. If your system doesn't have the
            following packages, you may need to obtain and install them. 
            You must also have GRUB installed, because CapROS is
            loaded by GRUB using the Multiboot specification.
          </p>
          <h3>2.1.2. For Fedora</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Some versions need transfig.
            </ul>
          <h3>2.1.3. For Debian Sarge</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>libgmp3-dev -- Multiprecision arithmetic library</li>
            <li>binutils-dev -- for libbfd</li>
            <li>gawk</li>
            </ul>
	  <h2>2.2. Building the Cross Compilation Tools</h2>
	  <p>
            CapROS uses its own cross-compilation tools 
            for stability.
            We acknowledge and thank the
            <a "http://www.coyotos.org/">Coyotos</a> project
            for hosting these tools. 
      <h3>2.2.1 Setting up on Linux/YUM Systems</h3>
      <p>
	If you are running Fedora, you can add the YUM
	repository to your <tt>yum</tt> and
	<tt>up2date</tt> configurations by executing:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'rpm -ivh http://www.coyotos.org/YUM/coyotos/6/i386/Coyotos-Repository-3.2-2.fc6.noarch.rpm'
</pre>
      <p>
	You can then install the cross compilation
	tools by running:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'yum install capros-i386-xenv'
</pre>
      <p>
	And you can later update the cross compilation
	tools by running:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'yum update capros-i386-xenv'
</pre>
      <p>
        (If the above fails, see 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=1147834740.31996.95.camel%40mikado64.cs.jhu.edu">
email of 5/16/06</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
	The <tt>capros-i386-xenv</tt> package is a
	"virtual" package - it simply supplies the necessary
	dependencies so that YUM will find all of the pieces you need.
        All of the CapROS cross environment tools install into
	the top-level directory <tt>/capros/</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, 
        refer to the 
        <a href="http://www.coyotos.org/docs/build/build.html#1.3">
        Coyotos build instructions</a>, substituting "capros" where
        appropriate.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2.2 Setting up on Fedora Core 8 using the GUI</h3>
	  <p>
	    If you are running on Fedora Core 8, you can add the build tools
	    to your automatic software update list with the following procedure.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Under "Applications", open the "Add/Remove Software" and enter your
	    root password when prompted.
            (Fedora 10 has an tool under
            System->Administration->Add/Remove Software, 
            but it isn't capable of adding repositories.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Open up the "Edit" menu and select "Repositories".
	  </p>
	  Click the "Add" button to add the Coyotos repository
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Fill in the fields:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
Name:         Coyotos RPMs
Description:  Development tools for Coyotos/CapROS
Location:     http://www.coyotos.org/YUM/coyotos/6/i386/
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    and click "OK".
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Close the Repository Manager.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Select the "Search" tab, and enter "Coyotos-Repository" in
	    the search.
	    When the search completes, check the check box for:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
Coyotos-Repository-3.2-2.fc6.noarch
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Click "Apply".  Click "Continue" on the popup.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Select the "Search" tab, and enter "capros-i386-xenv" in the search.
	    When the search completes, check the check box for:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
capros-i386-xenv - 0.1.6.4fc6.i386
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Click "Apply".  Click "Continue" on the popup.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2.3 Setting up on Other UNIX's</h3>
      <p>
	If you are building on some other UNIX
	derivative that does not support YUM, you may find
	that nothing will do but to build the cross environment for
	yourself. 
        For instructions, go to the
        <a href="http://www.coyotos.org/docs/build/build.html#1.4">
        Coyotos build instructions</a> for guidance.
        You may need to set COYOTOS_XENV to /capros/host and substitute
        "capros" where appropriate elsewhere. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>2.3. Building CapROS</h2>
	  <p>
            Follow the instructions on SourceForge for accessing 
            and downloading the CapROS CVS repository.
            The projectname is capros, and the module name is eros
            (we haven't yet changed the name of the module).
            After setting CVSROOT appropriately, use the command
	  <ul>
<pre>
cvs checkout -P eros
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
            At the moment there is no tarball for the CapROS sources.
            We will add this when the system becomes stable enough
            for non-developers. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Now you can build CapROS by
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src
make
</pre>
	  </ul>
          <p>
          Some make targets that may be useful:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>clean - remove all generated files
          <li>distclean - clean, and also remove install directories under eros/
          </ul>
	  <h2>2.4. Running a non-persistent test program</h2>
	  <p>
            The <em>target system</em> is the IA32 computer on which you will
            run CapROS. It could be the same as your development system
            or it could be a separate computer. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
            IA32 CapROS is loaded by <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/>
            GRUB</a>.
            To run CapROS, the target system must have a boot partition
            with a file system where GRUB will find the file to load.
            Define CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION as the name of this partition.
            For example, if the target system is the same as the
            development system:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION=/boot
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            The CapROS file is copied to the target system using <tt>scp</tt>.
            If the target system is a separate computer, you'll need to
            boot Linux (or any system that responds to
            <tt>scp</tt>) on that computer,
            and you'll need to configure it to allow <tt>ssh</tt>
            from the development computer.
            CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION can be any path acceptable to <tt>scp</tt>.
            If the target system's host name is "target", you would define:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION=target:/boot
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            To compile and load the test program into the target system:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/tutorials/hello-large
make np
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            To run the test program, boot the target computer, and type the
            following commands to GRUB:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
root (hd0,1)     # or the appropriate value for your boot partition
kernel --type=multiboot /CapROS-kernimg
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            You may wish to add an item to your GRUB menu.lst file
            with these commands. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>2.5. Running a persistent test program</h2>
	  <p> 
            CapROS supports USB disks.
            You must have a disk with a partition formatted for CapROS. 
	    Use your handy
	    <tt>fdisk</tt> equivalent to create a partition, and give it
	    type 0x95.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            We suggest that the partition size be several times the
            size of your RAM (for the checkpoint log)
            plus however much space you expect to need for application data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Before using the CapROS partition for the first time,
            you must format it. You do this on the development system
            by defining the shell variable EROS_HD as the device name
            for this partition. For example for a local disk:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export EROS_HD=/dev/hda1
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            or, for example for a USB disk:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export EROS_HD=/dev/sdb1
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            You can create your own volmap file to allocate the log
            and other space. Use tutorials/volmap as a starting point.
            Note that only the amount of space specified in the
            volmap file will be used. Any additional space in the
            partition will be ignored.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Then format the partition. You only need to do this once.
            This may take a while. 
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/tutorials/hello-large
make init.hd
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            Then build and load the persistent system, for example:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/base/tests/func/http
make p
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <h1>3. Supported Hardware</h1>

	  <h1><a name="ARMBuild">4. Building for ARM</a></h1>
	  <p>
          CapROS can run on the ARMv4 architecture.
          First, get the ARM cross-tools:
          </p>
<pre>
su -c 'yum install capros-arm-xenv'
</pre>
          <p>
          To build for ARM, you need to:
	  </p>
<pre>
export EROS_TARGET=arm
</pre>
	  <p>
          The system has been tested on a Cirrus EDB9315 development board,
          which uses the Cirrus EP9315,
          which is based on the ARM920T microprocessor.
          </p><p>
          To run on the EDB9315:
          <ol><li>
          Build the system for ARM.
          </li><li>
          Go to the directory containing the test case you want to run,
          for example src/base/tests/perf/nc.
          The kernel text, kernel data, and initial system state are loaded
          into the system's memory
          from three separate files in /tftpboot
          (kerneltext, kerneldata, and imgdata respectively).
          Build them:
<pre>
make np
</pre>
          </li><li>
          Set up Redboot according to the instructions that came with
          the EDB9315. To install tftp, you will need to:
<pre>
su -c 'yum install tftp-server'
</pre>
          and then use the application at System->Administration->Services
          to enable tftp and restart xinetd. 
          I also had to enable UDP port 69 in my firewall, and change the
          SELinux setting to Permissive. 
          </li><li>
          Boot the EDB9315 to execute Redboot. 
          Give Redboot the commands:
<pre>
load -v -r -b 0x00300000 imgdata
load -v -r -b 0x00100000 kerneldata
load -v -r -b 0x00200000 kerneltext
go
</pre>
          kerneltext is loaded last because that sets the default start
          address for the go command.
          Consider using Redboot aliases for these commands.
          </li></ol>
