	  <h1>1. Obtaining CapROS</h1>
	  <p>
	    If you just want to have a
	    look at the code, you can simply go to the 
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/capros/">
	    Project page</a>
            and click on "Develop" and then "Browse code".
            SourceForge also has instructions for getting
            anonymous access to CVS. 
	  </p>
	  <h1>2. Building CapROS</h1>
	  <p>
          The <b>host</b> system is the system on which you build CapROS
          and do any development.
          The <b>target</b> system is the system on which you run CapROS.
	  <p>
          These instructions apply when the host and target are both
          the Intel IA32 (x86) architecture.
          The target system could be the same computer as the host system
          (rebooted to run CapROS),
          or it could be a separate computer (possibly a virtual machine).
	  <p>
          A port also exists for the ARM architecture target; see
          <a href="#ARMBuild">below</a>. 
	  </p>
          <h2>2.1. Package Requirements</h2>
	  <p>
            CapROS is built using Linux. If your system doesn't have the
            following packages, you may need to obtain and install them. 
          </p>
          <h3>2.1.1. For Fedora</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Some versions need transfig.
            </ul>
          <h3>2.1.2. For Debian Sarge</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>libgmp3-dev -- Multiprecision arithmetic library</li>
            <li>binutils-dev -- for libbfd</li>
            <li>gawk</li>
            </ul>
	  <h2>2.2. Obtaining the Cross Compilation Tools</h2>
	  <p>
            Even though the host and target machines both have the
            Intel IA32 architecture, cross tools are necessary because
            most tools have dependencies on the underlying operating system.
            CapROS uses its own cross-compilation tools 
            for stability.
            We acknowledge and thank the
            <a "http://www.coyotos.org/">Coyotos</a> project
            for hosting these tools. 
	  <p>
            Tools are available for Fedora Core 10 (and earlier systems).
            We hope to have tools for later systems soon. 
            Some have had success building CapROS on Fedora Core 11. 
      <h3>2.2.1 Setting up on Linux/YUM Systems</h3>
      <p>
	If you are running Fedora, you can add the YUM
	repository to your <tt>yum</tt> and
	<tt>up2date</tt> configurations by executing:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'rpm -ivh http://www.coyotos.org/YUM/coyotos/6/i386/Coyotos-Repository-3.2-2.fc6.noarch.rpm'
</pre>
      <p>
	You can then install the cross compilation
	tools by running:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'yum install capros-i386-xenv'
</pre>
      <p>
	And you can later update the cross compilation
	tools by running:
      </p>
      <pre>
su -c 'yum update capros-i386-xenv'
</pre>
      <p>
        (If the above fails, see 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=1147834740.31996.95.camel%40mikado64.cs.jhu.edu">
email of 5/16/06</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
	The <tt>capros-i386-xenv</tt> package is a
	"virtual" package - it simply supplies the necessary
	dependencies so that YUM will find all of the pieces you need.
        All of the CapROS cross environment tools install into
	the top-level directory <tt>/capros/</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, 
        refer to the 
        <a href="http://www.coyotos.org/docs/build/build.html#1.3">
        Coyotos build instructions</a>, substituting "capros" where
        appropriate.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2.2 Setting up on Fedora Core 8 using the GUI</h3>
	  <p>
	    If you are running on Fedora Core 8, you can add the build tools
	    to your automatic software update list with the following procedure.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Under "Applications", open the "Add/Remove Software" and enter your
	    root password when prompted.
            (Fedora 10 has an tool under
            System->Administration->Add/Remove Software, 
            but it isn't capable of adding repositories.)
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Open up the "Edit" menu and select "Repositories".
	  </p>
	  Click the "Add" button to add the Coyotos repository
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Fill in the fields:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
Name:         Coyotos RPMs
Description:  Development tools for Coyotos/CapROS
Location:     http://www.coyotos.org/YUM/coyotos/6/i386/
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    and click "OK".
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Close the Repository Manager.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Select the "Search" tab, and enter "Coyotos-Repository" in
	    the search.
	    When the search completes, check the check box for:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
Coyotos-Repository-3.2-2.fc6.noarch
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Click "Apply".  Click "Continue" on the popup.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Select the "Search" tab, and enter "capros-i386-xenv" in the search.
	    When the search completes, check the check box for:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
capros-i386-xenv - 0.1.6.4fc6.i386
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	    Click "Apply".  Click "Continue" on the popup.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2.3 Setting up on Other UNIX's</h3>
      <p>
	If you are building on some other UNIX
	derivative that does not support YUM, you may find
	that nothing will do but to build the cross environment for
	yourself. 
        For instructions, go to the
        <a href="http://www.coyotos.org/docs/build/build.html#1.4">
        Coyotos build instructions</a> for guidance.
        You may need to set COYOTOS_XENV to /capros/host and substitute
        "capros" where appropriate elsewhere. 
	  </p>
	  <h2>2.3. Building CapROS</h2>
	  <p>
            Follow the instructions on SourceForge for accessing 
            and downloading the CapROS CVS repository.
            The projectname is capros, and the module name is eros
            (we haven't yet changed the name of the module).
            After setting CVSROOT appropriately, use the commands:
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd <i>somewhere</i>
cvs checkout -P eros
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
            At the moment there is no tarball for the CapROS sources.
            We will add this when the system becomes stable enough
            for non-developers. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Now you can build CapROS by
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd <i>somewhere</i>/eros/src
make
</pre>
	  </ul>
          <p>
          Some make targets that may be useful:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>clean - remove all generated files
          <li>distclean - clean, and also remove install directories under eros/
          <li>update - get the latest version
          </ul>
	<h1>3. Running CapROS</h1>
	  <h2>3.1. Supported Hardware</h2>
	  <p>
	    IA32 CapROS supports the following hardware (all
	    trademarks belong to their respective owners):

	      <td><strong>Processor</strong></td>
	      <td>486, Pentium, and above, and compatible processors.
                CapROS has been tested on a Pentium II, a Mobile AMD Athlon,

		We have no way to test every processor.
                If you have a problem with a particular processor,

	    </tr>
	  </table>
	  <h2>3.2. Target System Setup</h2>
	  <h3>3.2.1. GRUB configuration</h3>
	  <p>
            The target system must have
            <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/> GRUB</a>
            installed, because CapROS is
            loaded by GRUB using the Multiboot specification.
	  <p>
            The target system must have a boot partition
            with a file system where GRUB will find the file to load.
            Define CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION as the name of this partition.
            For example, if the target system is the same as the
            host system:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION=/boot
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            The CapROS file is copied to the target system using <tt>scp</tt>.
            If the target system is a separate computer, you'll need to
            boot Linux (or any system that responds to
            <tt>scp</tt>) on that computer,
            and you'll need to configure it to allow <tt>ssh</tt>
            from the host computer.
            CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION can be any path acceptable to <tt>scp</tt>.
            If the target system's host name is "target", you would define:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export CAPROS_BOOT_PARTITION=target:/boot
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            To boot CapROS, boot the target computer, stopping the boot
            when it comes to running GRUB. Type the
            following commands to GRUB:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
root (hd0,1)     # or the appropriate value for your boot partition
kernel --type=multiboot /CapROS-kernimg
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            You will probably want to add an item to your GRUB menu.lst file
            with these commands. 
	  </p>
	  <h3>3.2.2. Console configuration</h3>
	  <p>
            Console output can go to the display console and/or to the
            target system's serial port.
            The default configuration is to send console output to the
            display only.
	  <p>
            The display has the disadvantage that information you want
            can scroll off the top of the screen. 
            (Also, in the future when CapROS supports a windowing GUI
            on the display, console output can't go there.)
            If you want you can 
            change the configuration so console output is always sent to the
            serial port, and also to the display during kernel boot only.
            Also, in this configuration, the kernel debugger takes input from 
            the serial port instead of the target system's keyboard.
            To do this, define the following in your environment:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export EROS_CONFIG=DEVEL
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            To use the output on the serial port, you'll need to connect it
            to the serial port of another computer, using a "null modem" cable.
            A program such as minicom can then capture and display the output.
            The serial configuration is 57,600 baud, 8-N-1.
	  <h3>3.2.3. Network Configuration</h3>
	  <p>
            Network configuration means defining the IP address, mask,
            gateway, and security certificate for your target CapROS system.
            You only need to do this if you are using the IP network.
            Because this information is specific to each system,
            you should keep it in a place outside of the CapROS source tree.
            The CapROS source tree includes only a sample configuration
            which you should copy and modify.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Copy the sample configuration directory and files:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cp -r <i>somewhere</i>/eros/src/tutorials/config <i>myconfig</i>
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            You need to define the environment variable EROS_ROOT:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export EROS_ROOT=<i>somewhere</i>/eros
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            or you may simply define it in <i>myconfig</i>/Makefile.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Edit the file <i>myconfig</i>/eth.map to specify your
            IP address, mask, and gateway address.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            To use HTTPS, you need a security certificate and private key.
            You can generate a self-signed certificate by typing the
            following and answering a few questions:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd <i>myconfig</i>
make genkeys
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            Then install the files by typing:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd <i>myconfig</i>
make install
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>3.3. Running a non-persistent test program</h2>
	  <p>
            Make sure you rebuild CapROS after making any configuration changes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            To compile and load the test program into the target system:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/tutorials/hello-large
make np
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            To run the test program, boot CapROS as described above.
            You will see some messages as the kernel boots,
            followed by the output of the test program.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Other test programs you can run can be found in other
            directories under <tt>eros/src/tutorials</tt>
            and <tt>eros/src/base/tests</tt>.
	  </p>
	  <h2>3.4. Running a persistent test program</h2>
	  <h3>3.4.1. Disk setup</h3>
	  <p> 
            CapROS supports USB disks.
            You must have a USB disk with a partition formatted for CapROS. 
	    Use a disk utility such as
	    <tt>fdisk</tt> to create a partition, and give it
	    type 0x95.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            We suggest that the partition size be several times the
            size of your RAM (for the checkpoint log)
            plus however much space you expect to need for application data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Before using the CapROS partition for the first time,
            you must format it. You do this on the host system
            by defining the shell variable EROS_HD as the device name
            for this partition. For example:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
export EROS_HD=/dev/sdb1
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            You can create your own volmap file to allocate the log
            and other space. Use tutorials/volmap as a starting point.
            Note that only the amount of space specified in the
            volmap file will be used. Any additional space in the
            partition will be ignored.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Then format the partition. You only need to do this
            to the partition once.
            This may take a while. 
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/tutorials/hello-large
make init.hd
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>3.4.2. Running the Test Program</h3>
	  <p>
            Test programs that you can run can be found
            under <tt>eros/src/tutorials</tt>
            and <tt>eros/src/base/tests</tt>.
            If the directory has a <tt>pimgmap</tt> file,
            it is meant to be run in a persistent system,
            otherwise it is to be run in a non-persistent system.
            To build and load the test, type for example:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
<pre>
cd somewhere/eros/src/base/tests/func/http
make p
</pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
            There is a web-key demonstration in
            <tt>eros/src/tutorials/https</tt>.
            Be sure to read and follow the README file in that directory.

          </p>
<pre>
su -c 'yum install capros-arm-xenv'
</pre>
          <p>
          To build for ARM, you need to:
	  </p>
<pre>
export EROS_TARGET=arm
</pre>
	  <p>
          The system has been tested on a Cirrus EDB9315 development board,
          which uses the Cirrus EP9315,
          which is based on the ARM920T microprocessor.
          </p><p>
          To run on the EDB9315:
          <ol><li>
          Build the system for ARM.
          </li><li>
          Go to the directory containing the test case you want to run,
          for example src/base/tests/perf/nc.
          The kernel text, kernel data, and initial system state are loaded
          into the system's memory
          from three separate files in /tftpboot
          (kerneltext, kerneldata, and imgdata respectively).
          Build them:
<pre>
make np
</pre>
          </li><li>
          Set up Redboot according to the instructions that came with
          the EDB9315. To install tftp, you will need to:
<pre>
su -c 'yum install tftp-server'
</pre>
          and then use the application at System->Administration->Services
          to enable tftp and restart xinetd. 
          I also had to enable UDP port 69 in my firewall, and change the
          SELinux setting to Permissive. 
          </li><li>
          Boot the EDB9315 to execute Redboot. 
          Give Redboot the commands:
<pre>
load -v -r -b 0x00300000 imgdata
load -v -r -b 0x00100000 kerneldata
load -v -r -b 0x00200000 kerneltext
go
</pre>
          kerneltext is loaded last because that sets the default start
          address for the go command.
          Consider using Redboot aliases for these commands.
          </li></ol>
