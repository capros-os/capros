  <H1>EROS: A Novel Combination </H1>
</center>
<IMG src="../img/cupid1.gif" align=left>
<p> EROS combines an unusual collection of facilities into a single
package, hopefully in a novel way.  Each of these faclities is, in our
view, essential to providing scalable reliability, and all of them
have appeared in prior systems.  No prior system, however, has
integrated this particular combination of features in quite the same
way.
<P> Architecturally, the EROS system is most closely descended from an
earlier system known as KeyKOS.  We maintain a <A
HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS">KeyKOS Home Page</A>
containing a variety of public KeyKOS documents.
<p> The key features of the EROS system are:

      Because EROS processes are persistent, processes can hold

      completion.  The latter number includes critical drivers and the
      persistence manager.  No size tuning has been done.

</ul>
<p> Each of these issues is discussed in greater detail in the
sections below.
<h1>1. <a name="capabilities">Pure Capability Architecture</a></h1>
<p> EROS is a pure capability system.  A capability uniquely
identifies an object and a set of access rights.  Processes holding a
capability can perform the operations permitted by those access rights
on the named object.  Holding a capability is a <em>necessary and
sufficient</em> condition for accessing the associated object with the
authority granted by that capability.  There is no other way to
perform operations on an object.
<p> One advantage to the capability approach is that the EROS kernel
does not need to support any notion of user identity.  The login agent
hands each user their initial authorities, from which they can access
whatever objects are (transitively) reachable.
<p> Most capabilities can be <em>rescinded</em>.  For example, a
process holding access to a terminal port loses its authority on that
port each time the system is restarted.  This is necessary to ensure
that connections are re-established when appropriate.
<p> A common confusion about capabilities is that they are
incompatible with more conventional protection models.  While the EROS
kernel knows nothing about capabilities, user domains (processes) are
free to implement whatever authentication mechanisms they wish.  The
EROS unix emulator, for example, implements the customary unix
semantics based on user identity.
<h1>2. <a name="persistence">Orthogonal Global Persistence</a></h1>
<p> The basic idea of orthogonal global persistence is quite simple:
on a periodic basis, or when requested by an authorized application, a
<em>consistent snapshot</em> of the entire system state is taken.
This consistent snapshot includes the state of all running programs,
the contents of main memory, and any necessary supporting data
structures.  
<p> <em>Global</em> persistence means that the state of all processes
is captured at one instant; in the event that the system is forced to
recover from the snapshot, all applications are consistent with
respect to each other.  Several research systems provide the ability
to snapshot a single process.  EROS and a few others snapshot the
entire system state.
<p> <em>Orthogonal</em> persistence means that applications do not
need to take any special action to be a consistent part of the
snapshot.  The EROS unix emulator, for example, runs unmodified unix
binaries.  When EROS performs a checkpoint, these programs are
checkpointed without their ever being aware that a snapshot was
taken.  Perhaps more important, no special action is needed by these
applications to recover if the system fails.
<p> EROS persistence is a kernel service.  While this makes the EROS
kernel larger than non-persistent kernels such as QNX, non-persistent
kernels do not provide a comparable means of transparent recovery.
<p> A (true) story about keykos may provide some sense of the value of
orthogonal persistence:
<ul>
  <p> At the 1990 uniforum vendor exhibition, key logic, inc. found
  that their booth was next to the novell booth.  Novell, it seems,
  had been bragging in their advertisements about their recovery
  speed.  Being basically neighborly folks, the key logic team
  suggested the following friendly challenge to the novell exhibitionists:
  <em>let's both pull the plugs, and see who is up and running first.</em>
  <p> Now one thing Novell is <em>not</em> is stupid. They refused.
  <p> Somehow, the story of the challenge got around the exhibition
  floor, and a crowd assembled.  Perhaps it was gremlins.  Never eager
  to pass up an opportunity, the keykos staff happily spent the next
  hour kicking their plug out of the wall.  Each time, the system
  would come back within 30 seconds (15 of which were spent in the
  bios prom, which was embarassing, but not really key logic's fault).
  Each time key logic did this, more of the audience would give novell
  a dubious look.
  <p> Eventually, the novell folks couldn't take it anymore, and
  gritting their teeth they carefully turned the power off on their
  machine, hoping that nothing would go wrong.  As you might expect,
  the machine successfully stopped running.  Very reliable.
  <p> Having successfully stopped their machine, novell crossed their
  fingers and turned the machine back on.  40 minutes later, they were
  still checking their file systems.  Not a single useful program had
  been started.
  <p> Figuring they probably had made their point, and not wanting to
  cause undeserved embarassment, the keykos folks stopped pulling the
  plug after five or six recoveries.
</ul>
<p> In the end, the issue comes down to this.
<p> Suppose you had <em>perfect</em> software and hardware (if you
find some, be sure to let us know). Even so, your computer will fail
four to five times a year due to random background radiation.
<p> So when your computer fails, do you want to be told that all your
files are intact and you can now resume your painstaking work (having
lost your latest session), or would you rather have all of your
windows, (complete with word processor, web browser, and solitaire)
reappear with a few minutes lost work.  Take your pick.
<h1>3. <a name="threads">Kernel Threads</a></h1>
<p> The EROS kernel is multithreaded.  While this isn't obvious to an
application user, it has several useful consequences to kernel and
application developers:
<ul>
  <li> <em>Device drivers are greatly simplified.</em>  Conventional
       designs make it difficult for device drivers to remember what
       they were doing when they last executed.  By giving each
       controller its own thread, such state is naturally preserved on
       the stack.
       <p> More important, the resulting source code is infinitely
       more comprehensible. The core of colin mclean's floppy
       controller driver fits on a single page, compared to roughly
       three pages in the older (EROS93) kernel, which did not use
       kernel threads.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Code size is reduced.</em>  Compared to the previous
       generation of the EROS system (EROS93) at the same stage of
       development, the current version has 30% fewer instructions
       than the (12k savings).  Once the stack sizes on threads are
       tuned, we expect that the corresponding threads will require a
       total of 1.5k of stack space, so the overall memory footprint
       has been reduced by 10.5k.  This savings comes in many parts,
       including a simpler scheduling discipline, unified i/o
       architecture for kernel and user tasks, and reduction in driver
       size.
       <p> In addition, reimplementing kernel tasks as first-class
       threads shortened the interrupt path by approximately 5%.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Kernel activities are preemptible.</em> One challenge for
       multimedia designers in conventional kernels is the inability
       to defer kernel tasks.  this leads to difficult problems in
       admission control and scheduling.
       <p> Because EROS kernel tasks are scheduled using the same
       scheduler as user tasks, it is possible for time-critical tasks
       to run at higher priority than most parts of the kernel.
       Examples of kernel services that can be selectively preempted
       include:
       <p> 
       <ul>
	 <li> Disk drivers,
	 <li> Network drivers,
	 <li> Checkpoint agent,
	 <li> Core space ageing daemon (real-time domains will be
	      pinned),
	 <li> ... and so forth.
       </ul>
       <p> In fact, the only kernel services that are <em>not</em>
       preemptible are key invocations, which are guaranteed (by
       design) to involve predictable worst-case inter-yield latency.
</ul>
<p> The traditional objection to this of design has been the cost of
context switches.  Context switch cost can be divided into three
parts:
<p> 
<ol>
  <li> Saving the old thread's register set (cheap).
  <li> Switching to a new address space (very expensive).
  <li> Loading the new thread's register set (cheap).
</ol>
<p> In spite of the apparent expense, threaded drivers offer a
performance advantage over re-entrant drivers.  Each time it is
entered, a re-entrant driver must check a series of conditions to
determine the state of the hardware.  This typically requires tens of
instructions.  By contrast, reloading the register set of the
<strong>i486</strong> and <strong>pentium</strong> processors takes on
the order of 10 cycles.  While less dramatic, an advantage still
exists on processors with larger register sets
(e.g. <strong>mips</strong>, <strong>sparc</strong>,
<strong>alpha</strong>).
<p> EROS avoids the cost of switching address spaces by running driver
threads "parasitically."  Kernel threads run entirely within kernel
space, and the EROS kernel is mapped into every process addess space
at a common virtual address.  As a result, a context switch from a
user thread to a kernel thread does not require an address space
change.  Since the common case is that the same user thread is resumed
when the kernel thread has completed, this is a crucial optimization.
<!--
<h1><a name="preemption">Preemptive Scheduling</a></h1>
<p>

<h1>4. <a name="security">Security</a></h1>
<p> Security experts worry greatly about <em>confinment</em>.
Confinement is the process of making sure that information does not
leak to unauthorized users.
<p> While confinement remains a crucial problem in secure and
mission-critical applications, the confinement problem is not
currently very important.  The on-going fall in hardware prices,
coupled with the shift to client-server technology, has made this
problem fairly easy to solve.  To build a secure server, buy a
dedicated machine, turn off all network services except the one you
intend to run, and let that service performs its own authorization.
<p> Given this approach, the remaining security hazards come from
three sources:
<p> 
<ol>
  <li> Hardware bugs, some of which cannot be corrected by software.
  <li> Implementation bugs, such as failure to check input buffer lengths.
  <li> Misused authority, where a program operating with special
       privilege is made to use that privilege at an inappropriate time.
</ol>
<p> Hardware bugs present important difficulties that have received
inadequate attention.  Implementation bugs can usually be located by
suitable quality assurance procedures, rapidly isolatable, and easily
fixed.  Misused authority errors are extremely subtle, take a long
time to locate, and sometimes require redesign of the software.  A
clear example of a misused authority problem is presented in <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu:80/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html"><em>The
Confused Deputy</em></a>.
<p> Because EROS domains (processes) are first-class objects, they are
able to hold capabilities that are independent of the user's
capabilities.  EROS has no equivalent of the UNIX <em>superuser</em>
authority.  Capabilities refer to a specific object, so there is
little risk of abuse in a typically-designed domain.  The EROS
equivalent to <strong>sendmail</strong>, for example, holds specific
authorities for mail boxes and the sendmail configuration files.  No
matter how badly implemented <strong>sendmail</strong> may be, it is
provably <em>impossible</em> for it to modify any other objects in the
system.
<h2>4.1. The Renaissance of Confinement</h2>
<p> While confinement is not a terribly active problem in general
computing today, we are moving inevitably to a world in which it is a
vital concern.  Today's example is information services, which are
profitable only if they can control what you access.  
<p> In the next few years, however, we expect to see a rise in
<em>algorithm services</em>.  Where an information services provides
access to a data set, an algorithm service runs a program on demand,
possibly on your data, but more likely on third party data.
<p> As an example, consider an investment advisory program.  You (the
user) propose a set of investments with buy and sell dates, and the
program makes a prediction as to the expected profit from the
transaction.  There are two important privacy issues in such a
transaction:
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> You think you have a hot idea, and you don't want anyone
       else cashing in on your insight.  In particular, you want to
       know that the prediction program is not comparing your proposed
       strategies to everyone else's proposed strategies to benefit
       the financial advisor.
       <p>
  <li> The financial advisor thinks they have a hot market model, and
       they don't want you to be able to get your hands on it.
</ul>
<p> Neither side is willing to trust the other with their proprietary
information, but both sides wish to engage in the transaction.  The
EROS <strong>escrow agent</strong> mechanism provides a way to do this
that guarantees security to both sides.
