	  <b><a name="unix-diff">How is EROS related to Linux or other
	      UNIX systems?</a></b> 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Short Answer</b>: It isn't.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Longer Answer</b>:
	</p>
	<p>
	  EROS and UNIX-derivatives come from very different schools
	  about how operating systems should work.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For starters, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thomson (who built the
	  first UNIX system) set out in the second and subsequent
	  versions of UNIX to build an operating system that would
	  provide compatibility across multiple platforms.  With
	  considerable success, they build a system that provides a
	  common source-level environment across many types of
	  machines.  They accomplished this at a time when things as
	  basic as the size of a byte were not universally agreed on.
	</p>
	<p>
	  UNIX borrowed ideas heavily from MIT's Compatible Time
	  Sharing System (CTSS) and also from Multics.  From these
	  places came such ideas as files and directories, user
	  identities, and binary executable files.  Each of these
	  ideas, over the years, has proven to be a source of security
	  challenges or flaws in the system.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Where UNIX descends from CTSS and Multics, EROS descends
	  from KeyKOS (Key Logic, Inc.), which in turn descends from
	  Gnosis (Tymshare).  Gnosis was conceived from the ground up
	  as a secure and reliable operating system platform.  Two key 
	  decisions led the Gnosis effort in very different directions 
	  than Multics: paging and persistence.  Almost all of the
	  other differences in the system derive from these two
	  choices early in the Gnosis architecture.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When Multics was conceived, segmentation was the order of
	  the day.  Started several years later, the Gnosis framework
	  was based on paging rather than on segment loading.  The
	  impact of this is visible at all levels of the respective
	  designs:
	</p>
	<ul type=disc>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Where UNIX focuses on protecting files (a derivative of
	      segments), EROS defines protection at the granularity of
	      pages.  This finer granularity of protection can be
	      implemented on modern hardware MMUs directly, while
	      files require software interpretation.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Where UNIX was forced to introduce abstractions for
	      storing these files and translating them into runnable
	      process images (processes, file systems), EROS simply
	      gives every page a unique identity and then introduced a
	      different object -- the Node -- to hold capabilities to
	      pages and nodes.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Because UNIX processes are not preserved across restarts
	      (doing this on a segment-based design is quite hard),
	      some other means of validating access to files was
	      needed.  This caused user identities and access control
	      lists to be introduced.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      EROS, in contrast, simply preserves the processes across
	      restarts.  This means that there is no need to
	      revalidate authorities.  There is therefore no need to
	      introduce any idea of user identity into the EROS
	      supervisor.  Also, there is no need to have any notion
	      of a ``file'' in the supervisor -- the connectivity
	      established by Nodes and Pages doesn't disappear when
	      the system crashes.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Almost the only place where the two systems are similar is
	  in the area of networking.  A network connection is not
	  persistent, because it must be re-authenticated after a
	  system crash.  As a result, EROS has been able to borrow
	  heavily from the UNIX networking code.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <b><a name="unix-bin-compat"> Is it possible to run binaries
	  from Linux or other UNIX systems under EROS?  </a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Short Answer</b>: Not yet, but it will be.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Longer Answer</b>:
	</p>
	<p>
	  It's possible to build a UNIX environment that runs <em>on
	  top</em> of EROS, and we intend to do so.  That environment
	  will run both conventional UNIX binaries and will also be
	  able to access EROS-based services.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In fact, it will be possible to run multiple UNIX
	  environments at once.  If desired, each user can be given a
	  UNIX system that they fully control and adminster, without
	  compromising the security of the other UNIX environments on
	  the machine.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="why-secure"> Why is EROS secure?  </a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The answer to this is involved.  Here are a few basic
	  points:
	</p>
	<ul type=disc>
	  <li>
	    <p> 
	      EROS protection is fine-grained.  Instead of granting
	      programs all of the rights of some user, EROS grants
	      programs access to specific resources.  Each program
	      therefore runs with only the authority that it needs
	      (the ``principle of least privilege''), which makes it
	      inherently more secure.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p> 
	      EROS access rights are preserved across system
	      restarts.  This makes it feasible to divide access
	      rights across multiple processes without tearing out
	      your hair to get the interrelationships between those
	      processes right after every restart.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Also, there is no need for a file system, which is a
	      major source of security leaks.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Invocations of authority are explicit.  When an EROS
	      program invokes a capability, its authority comes from
	      the capability that it names, not from some ambient
	      status or authority that the process holds (i.e. not
	      from any notion of user identity).  One result is that
	      trusted programs are much harder to compromise.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Because EROS is capability based, it is possible to
	      strictly limit the communication channels that a program
	      has.  Among other things, user A can safely run software
	      from an untrusted user B and know that there are no
	      overt communication leaks.  This is the kind of security
	      that Java is trying (and failing) to provide.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  In the end, all of this combines to lead to a different
	  style of building programs.  EROS programs tend to be built
	  out of small, testable components.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="why-reliable"> Why is EROS reliable?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Once again, the answer to this question is involved.  A more 
	  complete answer can be found in one of the EROS white papers 
	  <a href="../essays/00Essays.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  EROS is reliable for basically the same reasons it is
	  secure.  Each EROS component can be built to do exactly what 
	  it should and no more.  This makes the components testable.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At the same time, EROS components live inside a protection
	  boundary.  This means that when they <em>do</em> go wrong it
	  is much harder for them to corrupt other components and much
	  easier to determine where the error really occurred.
