      This document is part of the EROS Frequently Asked Questions
      list.  To return to the main index, click <a

      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="hardware">What hardware does EROS run on?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The current system runs on x86-class PCs, 486 and higher.  The
	  386 is not supported.  The few multiprocessor boards we have
	  tested work, but in single processor mode.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The binaries have been run successfully on Intel 486 (several
	  variants), Pentium, and Pentium Pro systems.  We have not tested
	  AMD or Cyrix chips.  Small modifications will be needed to the
	  chip recognition code for those chips, but as far as we know the
	  kernel should then support them without difficulty.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Support for networking is limited.  At the moment, the only
	  network interface cards supported are the 3COM 3c509/3c509b
	  (10 Mbit, ISA) and the 3COM 3c905 (10/100 Mbit, PCI) cards.  It
	  should be easy to add other cards, but our work hasn't required
	  that.  We are particularly interested in adding a driver for the 
	  Tulip-based cards such as the SMC cards.
	</p>
	<p>
	  IDE and EIDE drives are fully supported.  SCSI will be handled
	  in the future, but is not currently supported.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is currently no graphics support.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are not aware of any peculiar BIOS dependencies.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="no-386">Why not on the 386?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The 386 supervisor mode does not honor the write-protect bit in
	  the page table entries.  One critical piece of EROS code relies
	  on the write-protect bit being honored.  Alternative code would
	  not be difficult to write, but at this point there are few
	  enough 386 machines out there that I decided not to bother.

	  Please see the cross-environment documentation.  The section
	  describing host requirements can be found <a
	  href="../devel/CrossGuide/cross-env.html#inst-reqt">here</a>.
