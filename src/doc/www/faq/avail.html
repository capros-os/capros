      This document is part of the EROS Frequently Asked Questions
      list.  To return to the main index, click <a

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="when-release">When will EROS be available?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Experience suggests that I should not answer this question
	  with a date, as all of my previous dates have been wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
	  EROS is the heart of my doctoral thesis.  The plan from the
	  beginning has been to release the system when the
	  measurements necessary for my dissertation were finished, or
	  shortly thereafter.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Pragmatically, there will be a delay of several weeks from
	  that point. I want to do some code cleanup (removing
	  vestigial code that is ifdef'd out and will never work
	  again) and make sure that all of the test cases run prior to
	  releasing the code base.  There will also need to be
	  documentation enhancements.  Since the document web can be
	  updated daily, these can probably wait until after the code
	  base is made available.
	</p>
	<p>
	  ``So,'' you ask, ``how far away is the measurement from
	  happening?  I want to try this thing!''
	</p>
	<p>
	  Here are the work items that need to be completed:
	</p>
	<ul type=disc>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      A TCP/IP stack needs to be ported to EROS.  This is well
	      underway, but it is revealing bugs in some of the
	      supporting code that take a while to locate and repair.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The TCP/IP stack is by far the largest chunk of code
	      that anyone has attempted to port so far.  The good news 
	      is that the bugs I am finding will make subsequent
	      efforts much easier to deal with.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      A web server needs to be ported.  This will take some
	      effort, but hopefully not as much as the TCP/IP stack.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      That web server needs to be benchmarked, and the
	      systematic behavior of EROS underneath it needs to be
	      measured.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  I have reasonable confidence that the dissertation will be written 
	  over this summer (1998).
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="source-where">Where can I obtain the source code?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Short answer</b>: wait for the release.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Longer answer</b>:
	</p>
	<p>
	  Regrettably, there have already been a few examples of
	  people hearing of a good idea in EROS and adapting it into
	  other systems without crediting the source.  While I'm glad
	  that this has happened, I'm not at all happy about the lack
	  of credit.  In a few cases, it has made my job much harder
	  because I am now competing against my own work.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are a small number of people who have read-only access
	  to the source tree, and two or three who are actively
	  working on some of the EROS components.  Jonathan Adams
	  (Cal-Tech), in particular, has been extremely helpful over
	  the past year.

	  <b><a name="terms">Is EROS Free Software?  What are the
	      terms of use?</a></b> 
	</p>
	<p>
	<em>Heartfelt thanks to Robin Lee Powell for reminding me to
	update this section!</em> 
	</p>
	<p>
          EROS is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
          and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). A detailed
          description of the licensing terms may be found on the <a
          href="../legal/terms.html">Distribution Terms</a> page.
          Extensive discussion of (L)GPL license and what it means may
          be found at the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
          Foundation</a> web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because EROS is a component-based system, it does not rely as
          heavily on linking as conventional systems. Given this,
          applying the ``work based on the program rule of GPL is not
          always easy to understand.  The terms page gives some
          guidelines for when a newly introduced component must be
          distributed under GPL. The rules are a work in progress. The
          current set has two purposes:
        </p>
	<ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              They try to preserve the ``freely available'' character
              of the EROS system by preventing modifications that
              would render critical portions of the system
              proprietary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              They try to protect the security of the system by
              requiring that security-critical components be made
              public.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	  Earlier releases of EROS were made available under more
	  restrictive licenses. Now that this is a thing of the past,
	  I can admit the real reason for it: EROS wasn't ready for
	  other people to play yet.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Successful open source efforts seem to follow a couple of
	  rules. One of these rules is that they begin with some
	  critical mass of cohesive software that serves as a template
	  that a community can react on. In the course of building
	  the original EROS system, it became clear that another major
	  round of work on the kernel would be required. Since getting
	  my dissertation done was also a priority, I crafted a
	  license that would allow people to start getting a sense of
	  the system <em>without</em> creating a large user base that
	  would require care and feeding.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We also had concerns about security and provenance
	  management, which is the next topic.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Concerns About Open Source</em>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Open source raises a concern in the context of secure
	  systems: how can a recipient have confidence that they have
	  received a trustworthy system?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of secure systems, the great strength of open
	  source is also its greatest weakness: anyone can modify the
	  code. In order for a non-technical user to safely use such a
	  system, they need to have some <em>assurance</em> that what
	  they receive is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          For engineers, ``assurance'' is an uncomfortable word. While
	  assurance processes help produce better systems, assurance
	  is not really about whether a system is correct; it is about
	  whether a customer can have <em>confidence</em> that a
	  system is correct. An oft-quoted open source mantra: ``read
	  the source,'' is not helpful to typical users. Most users
	  lack the necessary expertise to productively read source
	  code. But even if they could, there is a more subtle
	  problem: <em>which</em> source?
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the customer cannot read the source, the problem of
	  confidence must be broken down into two pieces:
	</p>
        <ul>
	  <li>
            <p>
              Somebody needs to choose a set of sources, read them (or
              more broadly, apply appropriate assurance processes),
              and package them for redistribution. This assurance
              activity is a <em>service</em> provided to the end
              customer. It may or may not be backed by a guarantee,
              and the guarantee may or may not have financial
              ``compensation'' (a.k.a. insurance) associated with it.
            </p>
          </li>
	  <li>
            <p>
              Both the customer and the provider need a way to agree
              that the system the customer received is in fact the
              system that the provider assured.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
	<p>
          It took a while to figure out how to ensure all of this in
          an open source model.  In the end, the key proved to be
          simple: branding. We will be fairly aggressive about
          protecting whatever name the system is ultimately assured
          under. Actually, we will need to use separate brands: one
          for the system and the second for the assured version. The
          official release will also be digitally signed or one-way
          hashed so that users can verify its authenticity.
	</p>
	<p>
          Others, of course, can independently assure versions of the
          system under their own brands.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <b><a name="join-team">What if I want to join the EROS team?</a></b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point, we could probably make good use of two or
	  three more people to work on various projects.  If you are
	  interested in joining the EROS developer group, and you are
	  in the Silicon Valley area, I'ld be very happy to talk with
	  you.  What we need at this point are people who are
	  knowledgeable in C and C++ and have experience doing
	  low-level debugging.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Why Silicon Valley only? Experience in teaching about this
	  system at Penn shows that coming up to speed on the EROS
	  code base can be accomplished in several weeks
	  <em>provided</em> that face-to-face conversations (with a
	  whiteboard) are possible.  At the moment, my primary
	  attention has to go to finishing the dissertation, which
	  means that I don't have time to work with a broader group
	  for a few more months.
