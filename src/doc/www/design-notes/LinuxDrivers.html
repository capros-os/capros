  </center>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      Each driver will have:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>An address space
<li>A supernode for key storage
<li>A number of threads, that is, processes sharing the address space and supernode
</ul>
    <p>
      A portion of the address space will be reserved for thread stacks,
      each in a fixed address range. 
      For reliability, each stack is bounded by an unmapped page,
      to detect stack overflow.
      A thread can find out which stack
      it is using by arithmetic on its stack pointer. A table relates
      stacks to threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thread (the "server thread") will receive requests from a start key.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thread (the "sync thread") will perform certain synchronization 
      between threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be one or more threads to service interrupts (see below).
      There may be one or more threads used to sleep (see below).
      There may be one or more stacks (but probably not threads)
      used in conjunction with wait queues (see below).
    </p>
    <h1>Configuration</h1>
    <p>
      File base/lib/linux-headers/linux/autoconf.h is taken from a
      configured Linux kernel. It should have the Preemptible Kernel
      option selected, as that most closely approximates the
      emulation environment, which has independent processes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The SMP option might also be useful, but there doesn't seem
      to be a way to select it for ARM EP93xx using menuconfig.
    </p>
    <h1>Support for Linux Features</h1>
    <p>
      The Linux kernel makes a number of features available to device drivers.
      Here is how we plan to support these features in CapROS.
    </p>
    <h2>Semaphores</h2>
    <p>
      Semaphores and read-write semaphores will be supported
      using a shared structure with a count that is updated atomically.
      If a process needs to wait or wake up another process,
      it will make a CALL invocation to the Sync process to do the work.
      In the (hopefully common) case where there is no contention,
      no context switches are required. 
     </p>
    <h2>Mutexes</h2>
    <p>Mutexes will be implemented as semaphores. 
       A more efficient implementation may be done later.
    <h2>Spinlocks</h2>
    <p>Spinlocks differ from semaphores in that they can be used at
       interrupt level, where suspending the current process is not an option.
       In CapROS, interrupt processing for a driver will be done in a
       user-mode process, so this restriction does not apply.
       In CapROS spinlocks will become mutexes or semaphores,
       and read-write spinlocks will become read-write semaphores.</p>
    <h2>Wait Queues</h2>
    <p>Wait queues can be handled in a general way that preserves
       the stack at the point of waiting, in a manner similar to sleeping
       (see below).
       However, wait queues are often used to have the
       client-requested operation wait
       for some event. Interactions with the driver client require
       CapROS-specific code, so in many cases it may be feasible to handle
       client waiting differently.
       We can enqueue a continuation procedure on the queue,
       with access to the client's resume key. </p>
    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>The general way to support sleep (that is, without knowledge of the
       driver code) is as follows. If the thread sleeping is the server thread,
       create a new thread. The new thread uses the original thread's stack;
       it will be the sleeping thread.
       The old thread gets a new stack, remains the server thread,
       and receives new requests.
       The current resume key moves to the new thread. </p>
    <p>Then, the sleeping thread sleeps and returns to the caller of msleep().
       Eventually it will reply to the resume key. Then, it will notice
       that it is not the server thread, and terminate the thread.</p>
    <p>In the specific case of the serial port driver, sleeping is used
       for only two things. One is a delay after close(), which will
       probably be handled outside the driver. The other is in a loop
       polling to see if the transmitter is empty. For reliability we
       may create a single timer thread that just does that. 
    <p>Supported procedures are:</p>
    <table>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>msleep</code></td> <td>
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>msleep_interruptible</code></td> <td>
    Since there are no signals in CapROS, this is the same as msleep.
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>ssleep</code></td> <td>
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>jiffies</code></td> <td>
    This will expand to a procedure call to get the time
    using capros_Sleep_getTimeMonotonic().
  </td></tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Interrupts</h2>
    <p>The procedure <code>request_irq</code> registers a handler for
       an interrupt. This will create a thread that loops waiting for an
       interrupt and executing the handler.
       <code>free_irq</code> deregisters the handler.</p>
    <h2>Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>We look critically at dynamic allocation in drivers, because
       allocation failures are a potential source of unreliability.
       Still, it seems we will have to suppport it.</p>
    <p>So far we only support the GFP_KERNEL flag, and we don't guarantee
       that the memory occupies contigous physical addresses. 
       So far we haven't seen other requirements.</p>
    <p>We use the C library procedures malloc() and free(), and supply
       an sbrk() that allocates space following BSS. For convenience
       we will use a VCSK to allocate pages in memory; in the future
       it might be better to do something more lightweight. </p>
    <p>Supported procedures are:</p>
    <table>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>kmalloc</code></td> <td>
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>kfree</code></td> <td>
    amba_pl010.c only calls kfree at remove time.
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>kzalloc</code></td> <td>
    amba_pl010.c only calls kzalloc to allocate a structure at probe time.
  </td></tr>
    </table>
     <p><code>__get_free_pages</code> and <code>free_pages</code>
       can be supported
       by allocating addresses in the same range used to map
       device registers, and getting pages from the space bank.
       They will not be contiguous in physical memory.</p>
    <h2>Device Registers</h2>
    <p>Following POLA, I would like to grant access to
       only the page(s) needed. If the big bang grants access to only
       one process, request/release_mem_region can be nops.</p>
    <p>For ioremap() and iounmap(), there is a region of the address space
       reserved for mapping device registers. 
       The driver gets access to the pages it needs via a node
       containing resource keys including physical pages.</p>
    <h2>Clock Control</h2>
    <p>The Linux files clk.h and clock.c provide support for enabling
       and disabling various hardware clocks. A clock is enabled if
       there is any driver that requires it.</p>
    <p>Because this functionality spans different drivers, for POLA
       it will be implemented in a separate object.
       There will be one object for each type of clock.
       Each driver will have a key to manipulate only the type(s) of clock
       that it needs.</p>
    <p>The UART clock may be a special case because a UART can be used
       as a console during boot and for kprintf().</p>
    <p>Supported procedures are:</p>
    <table>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>clk_disable</code></td> <td>
    This procedure counts the caller as no longer a user of the clock.
    When there are no users, the clock is disabled.
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>clk_enable</code></td> <td>
    This procedure counts the caller as a user of the clock,
    and enables the clock.
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>clk_get</code></td> <td>
    This procedure accesses a clock by looking up its name.
    amba-pl010.c uses the "UARTCLK".
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>clk_get_rate</code></td> <td>
    On ep93xx, returns the UART clock rate of 14,745,600 Hz.
  </td></tr>
  <tr> <td valign="top"><code>clk_put</code></td> <td>
    This procedure destroys the clock obtained by clk_get().
    However, since clock objects are permanent, this does nothing.
  </td></tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Diagnostic Output</h2>
    <p><code>printk</code> will be implemented using kprintf.
      Drivers will have a key register KR_OSTREAM for console output.
    <h2>Performance issues</h2>
    <p>Spinlocks are frequently used. In Linux on a uniprocessor this simply
    disables interrupts. On CapROS it does an atomic operation, which,
    on ARM architectures prior to 6, traps to the kernel.
    <h1>Serial Port Driver</h1>
    <p>
      The Linux serial port driver has a number of interrelated parts, including
      the low-level hardware driver, various line disciplines or protocols,
      tty devices, and consoles. 
      As you might expect with a monolithic kernel, in Linux there seems
      to have been little incentive to structure these relationships
      with modularity in mind. In addition, some of this code
      is immodular simply for historical reasons. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The code to support tty devices, consoles, and file I/O is quite
      Linux-specific, and we do not plan to port that code.
      Code to handle the 17 line disciplines (which include input-line editing,
      SLIP, PP, X25, IrDa, HDLC, etc.) may be ported as needed.
      We do not expect frequent changes here, as the protocols are
      governed by standards, so we are willing to tolerate a high
      degree of customization for CapROS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low-level hardware handler for specific serial port (UART)
      hardware will be ported with minimal change by emulating
      the Linux environment. In the case of our ARM hardware,
      this consists of the single file drivers/serial/amba-pl010.c. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This driver uses many of the facilities described above, and also
      the following that are more specific to serial ports.
    </p>
