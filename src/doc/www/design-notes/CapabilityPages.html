    <p class=initial>
      This note describes the initial design for EROS capability
      pages.
      <p>Capability pages will not be implemented, for the following reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>They expose the size of the kernel implementation of a capability.
          We prefer not to expose this, so the implementation can be
          changed without affecting code outside the kernel.
      <li>The simple implementation of capability pages has them mapped
          into the process's address space, but with access permitted
          only in kernel mode. The simple implementation of access checking
          for strings passed in key invocations is to check that the string
          is mapped and accessible. Since this check is done in the kernel,
          it would be possible to send or receive a string in a
          capability page, which is a no-no. 
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>1. Basic Idea</h2>
    <p class=initial>
      Certain EROS processes want to manage a large number of
      capabilities.  The base EROS system provides no mechanism to do
      so <em>efficiently</em>.  While we could adopt the KeyKOS
      approach and implement a supernode, this is fairly expensive on
      machines with a slow privilege crossing mechanism.
    </p>
    <ul>
	It should be noted that the x86 privilege crossing delay is a
	disaster, and the KeyKOS supernode approach is entirely
	appropriate for machines with lesser delays of this form
	(e.g. most modern RISC machines).  The mechanism proposed here
	would remain faster on such machines, but only by a factor of
	4 or so rather than a factor of 400.  given a machine with a
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the performance issue, it is convenient to be
      able to share a pool of such capabilities in the same way that
      one shares memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it would in some instances be very convenient to have a
      capability stack that it parallel to the data stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an ideal world, capabilities would be a hardware-protected
      first class data type (requiring a side bit in the memory).  The
      proposed mechanism comes as close to realizing this as can be
      practically accomplished on current generation hardware.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Capability Pages</h2>
    <p class=initial>
      Capability pages provide a page-sized equivalent to a node.  A
      capability in 32-bit EROS systems occupies 16 bytes.  The number
      of such capabilities in a page is architecture dependent, but
      this design assumes that capabilities will be densely packed
      within a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capability pages are addressed in the same way as physical
      pages: by inserting them into segments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because capability pages can be shared via segments, the KeyKOS
      ``sensory'' notion must be replaced in EROS by a combination of
      ``weak'' and ``read-only'' attributes.  A ``weak'' capability is
      one that applies the sense transformation to all capabilities
      fetched through it.  A read-only capability prohibits writing.
      The combination of these two constraints is functionally
      equivalent to the KeyKOS sensory capability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both attributes are interpreted hierarchically in a memory
      context, which has the desired effect on controlling exposure
      across an entire memory segment.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 Page Types and Access Types</h3>
    <p class=initial>
      In the proposed design, a page frame holds either capabilities
      or data, but never both.  Data references to a capability page
      cause suitable access violations.  Capability references to a
      data page similarly cause access violations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of what to <em>do</em> about such faults remains a
      policy decision to be made by a keeper.  This requires that the
      kernel now report to the keeper some encoding of the following
      information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Whether a page exists at the referenced address.
      <li> What type of page exists at the referenced address
	(capability or data).
      <li> What type of access was performed to that address
	(capability or data).
    </ul>
    <p>
      To handle this, we revise the existing segment fault codes to
      the following:
    </p>
    <center>
      <table>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_CapInvalidAddr</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A capability reference was made to a location 
	      where no valid page (of any kind) exists.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_DataInvalidAddr</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A capability reference was made to a location 
	      where no valid page (of any kind) exists.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_CapTypeError</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A capability operation was performed to a data page.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_DataTypeError</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A data operation was performed to a capability page.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_CapAccess</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A capability write was performed to a capability page
	      along a mapping that is read-only.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td><strong>FC_DataAccess</strong></th>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      A data write was performed to a capability page
	      along a mapping that is read-only.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    <p>
      For reporting purposes, type errors have higher precedence than
      access violations.  A data write to a read-only capability
      therefore generates FC_DataTypeError rather than FC_DataAccess.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Implementation</h3>
    <p class=initial>
      Capability pages require that we extend the existing ``type
      tag'' for disk pages from {page, log frame, node frame, alloc
      pot} to {data page, capability page, log frame, node frame,
      alloc pot}, and keep a type tag on pages in memory so that we
      can keep track of what they hold.  The necessary tag fields are
      already present; tracking the tag has no marginal data overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capability manipulations are performed by four kernel-emulated
      instructions:
    </p>
    <center>
      <table width="85%">
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td nowrap><strong>copycap %cr1,%cr2</strong></td>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      Copies a capability from capability register
	      <code>%cr2</code> to capability register
	      <code>%cr1</code>.  Has no effect if
	      <code>%cr1</code> is capability register zero.
	    <p>
	      Because this is an indivisible instruction generating no 
	      exceptions, it can be special-case coded in the kernel.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td nowrap><strong>xchgcap %cr1,%cr2</strong></td>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      Exchanges the values of <code>%cr1</code> and register
	      <code>%cr2</code>.  If either register is capability
	      register zero, it's value remains unchanged.
	    <p>
	      Because this is an indivisible instruction generating no 
	      exceptions, it can be special-case coded in the kernel.
	    </p>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td nowrap><strong>cload %cr1, <em>address</em></strong></td>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      Loads the capability at <em>address</em> into capability 
	      register <code>%cr1</code>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Exceptions:
	    </p>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><strong>FC_CapInvalidAddr</strong></th>
		<td>
		  <p>
		    <em>address</em> has no mapping in the domain's
		    address space.
		  </p>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><strong>FC_CapTypeError</strong></th>
		<td>
		  <p>
		    <em>address</em> names a data page in the domain's
		    address space.
		  </p>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
	  <td nowrap><strong>cstore %cr1, <em>address</em></strong></td>
	  <td>
	    <p>
	      Stores the capability in capability register
	      <code>%cr1</code> at <em>address</em>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Exceptions:
	    </p>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><strong>FC_CapInvalidAddr</strong></th>
		<td>
		  <p>
		    <em>address</em> has no mapping in the domain's
		    address space.
		  </p>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><strong>FC_CapTypeError</strong></th>
		<td>
		  <p>
		    <em>address</em> names a data page in the domain's
		    address space.
		  </p>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><strong>FC_CapAccess</strong></th>
		<td>
		  <p>
		    <em>address</em> names a read-only capability page
		    in the domain's address space.
		  </p>
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </center>
    <p>
      It may prove useful in the future to introduce a related
      pseudo instruction <strong>cprobe
	<em>address</em></strong>, which initiates a page fault
      but does not block the calling process.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may also prove useful in the future to extend the current IPC 
      invocation instructions with an instruction that permits the
      invoked capability to reside in memory.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Other Proposals</h2>
    <p class=initial>
      Mark Miller has proposed an alternative to the above
      instructions based on a memory-memory architecture rather than a
      register-memory architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this proposal, a data load from a capability page returns the 
      referenced address.  A data store of a value to a capability
      page interprets the value as a <em>source</em> capability
      address, and copies the capability at that address to the
      referenced address.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal has the advantage that it allows capability
      references to be treated as first-class data structures by the
      compiler with approximately the right semantics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have decided not to pursue this approach for now for two
      reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  I am not convinced that the memory-memory architecture is
	  what we want.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Without careful thought, I am reluctant to do this by
	  overloading the data instructions.  I am mildly concerned
	  about the loss of fault reporting.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm recording the proposal here because it is interesting, and
      because it might significantly simplify the implementation of
      the capability cache logic.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Issues in Implementation</h2>
    <p class=initial>
      The following issues have arisen in the course of implementing
      this change.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a difficulty with allowing prepared keys in capability
      pages.  The nature of the problem is that the page may be
      involved in I/O, and the I/O might therefore cause the prepared
      form of the key to be written to disk.  There are two ways to
      solve this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> 
	<p>
	  Do not allow prepared keys within capability pages
	</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
	<p>
	  Deprepare all keys in a capability page before performing
	  I/O or page eviction.  Before preparing any key in a
	  capability page, check for the I/O case (in which case the
	  page is guaranteed to be dirty) and treat the page as
	  requiring copy on write if a key must be prepared within it.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The latter solution becomes utterly necessary if we allow the
      invoked key to be specified by a memory address.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ancillary performance issue arises, which is that unlike
      nodes, the keys in capability pages must be forcibly deprepared
      at every checkpoint, because there are no capability page pot
      equivalents.
