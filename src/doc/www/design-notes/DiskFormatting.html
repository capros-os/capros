  <H1>Disk Formatting and Layout</H1>
</center>
<p> This note describes how the disk formatting logic works in the
CapROS system, and how CapROS volumes are structured.  Both disk
partitioning and range creation/deletion are covered.
<p>
Note that the current implementation does not provide for live
creation of new volumes, so the discussion of partition creation
should be taken with suitable skepticism; it snapshots what we intend
to do when the online disk partitioning/formatting utility is written.
<H2>1 Disks and Partitions</H2>
<p> Disks can be divided into multiple, independent chunks known as
<strong>partitions</strong>.  Each partition constitutes a logical
disk volume.  CapROS, for the most part, deals in terms of disk volumes.
CapROS volumes, in turn, are divided into <strong>ranges</strong>,
described below.
<p>
Over the life of a disk, it may prove convenient to add or remove
partitions/volumes, and to adjust the content of existing volumes.
<h3>1.1 Adding New Partitions</h3>
<p> Adding new volumes (paritions) must be done carefully for the sake
of consistency, but it isn't especially difficult to do.  The
principle challenge is to defend against disk failure during format.
The creation of new CapROS partitions proceeds in steps:
<ol>
  <li> Create a partition of non-CapROS type.  This ensures that if a
       failure occurs while partition format is in progress the
       partition will not be seen as a CapROS partition.
       <p> 
  <li> Obtain a raw disk range key to the new partition.  Use it to
       write a proper CapROS-formatted volume image to the new
       partition.  At a minimum, this would include a boot block and
       an empty pair of range tables.
       <p>
  <li> Delete the partition, and create a new partition covering the
       same range of sectors that is really a CapROS partition
       (i.e. retype the partition).
       <p> 
  <li> Tell CapROS to try and mount the newly created partition.
</ol>
<h3>1.2 Deleting Existing Partitions</h3>
<p> There are two cases to consider when deleting CapROS partitions. 
CapROS treats the case of an <em>unplanned</em> deletion
the same as if the disk became unreachable due to removal or failure,
which of course means that any data that existed solely on that disk
is lost. This can cause critical software components to fail.
Another problem is that data in the checkpoint log destined for the
removed partition will be unmigrateable. 
<p> <em>Planned</em> deletion of a partition involves migrating
all the data on it elsewhere.  
The Object IDentifiers of the data do not change.
Most likely this will use mirroring/duplexing as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Create and mount a new partition with ranges that duplicate the
  ranges in the partition to be deleted. This may be on a different disk.
  <li> Dirty all the objects in the partition.
  <li> Wait for those dirty objects to be checkpointed and migrated to
  both partitions. 
  <li> Dismount the partition to be deleted.
</ol>
<p> The question of how to actually reduce the amount of data in the system,
so disk space can be permanently freed, is beyond the scope of the
current design of the system.

<H2>2 Ranges</H2>
<p>
CapROS views each logical volume as further divided into ranges.
This section describes the range types,
and the formatting of each range type <em>as seen by the kernel</em>.
All ranges are an exact
multiple of the architecture page size; extra trailing sectors, if
any, are unused.
<p>In the kernel code, ranges are called Divisions; should we change
this documentation to match?
<H3>2.1 Range Types</H3>
<p>
Ranges come in a variety of types.
<ul>
  <TABLE>
    <TR VALIGN=top>
      <TD><B>Range Table</B></TD>
      <TD>The range table contains the list of all ranges present on the
	volume, including itself.  At least one
	range table is required on every volume.  There may be multiple
	range tables on a given volume (for redundancy).
        <p>How to find the range table?
	<p>
	Each range table entry contains the following information:
	<ul>
	  <table>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td width="90"><b>start</b></td>
	      <td>The sector number, relative to the start of the volume,
		at which the range begins.</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td><b>end</b></td>
	      <td>The (exclusive) sector number, relative to the start of
		the volume, at which the range ends.</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td><b>Start OID</b></td>
	      <td>The unique object identifier (OID) of the first object
		within the range.  Note that this is also the OID of the
		first object <em>frame</em> within the range.
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td><b>End OID</b></td>
	      <td>The (exclusive) unique object identifier (OID) of the last object
		within the range.  Ranges never contain partial frames.
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td><b>Type</b></td>
	      <td>The range type.
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td><b>Flags</b></td>
	      <td>A flags field, which is currently unused.
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	</ul>
      </TD>
    </TR>


    <TR VALIGN=top>
      <TD><B>Object</B></TD>
      <TD>An object range holds pages and nodes (and other types of objects,
        should we implement them).
	There can be multiple object ranges on a volume, and all
	mounted object ranges act together as the data space for CapROS.
	Every object in CapROS has a unique home location in some Object
	Range.
        Object ranges are further described below.
      </TD>
    </TR>

    <TR VALIGN=top>
      <TD><B>Log</B></TD>
      <TD>Log ranges hold the log areas used for checkpointing. Modified
	objects are periodically written to the log, and are later
	migrated to their home locations.  There can be many log
	ranges in a partition, and all mounted checkpoint log areas
	act as a single log used for checkpointing.
	<p>
	Every CapROS system <em>must</em> have a log range containing
	log locations zero and one, which contain the most recent two
	checkpoint headers. 
Is this correct?
      </TD>
    </TR>
    <TR VALIGN=top>
      <TD><B>Unused</B></TD>
      <TD>The unused range type identifies an unused entry in
	the range table.
      </TD>
    </TR>
  </table>
</ul>
<p>
No provision is made for allocating spare space for use in the event of
disk failure, because both IDE and SCSI provide transparent sparing.
<p>
There is no boot range and no kernel range. It is presumed that the disk
contains another partition which contains the GRUB boot loader, the kernel,
and the preloaded range(s). This partition is formatted with a boot
sector and a traditional file system understood by GRUB. 
We also need to document somewhere how systems will be booted from ROM.
<H2>3 Object Ranges</H2>
	<p>
	Object ranges are made up of a sequence of <em>clusters</em>.
        Every cluster begins with a disk frame known as a <em>tag pot</em>,
        followed by a fixed number of <em>object frames</em>.
  The size of a cluster is determined by the
number of Object Frames a Tag Pot can keep track of.
        (The last cluster in a range may have fewer object frames.)
        All frames are the size of the architecture's page.
  So the Object
Range looks like:
<p>
<PRE>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| TagPot | ObjFrm |...Object Frames...| ObjFrm | TagPot | ObjFrm | ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 \_____________________   _____________________/
                       \ /
                     cluster
</PRE>
<p>
Each Object Frame contains one or more objects of a single type (node or page).
The type is specified in the tag pot.
The type of the frame determines how the Frame is laid out, as follows:
<ul>
<LI>If the object is the size of a Frame (namely, a Page),
    the frame is completely taken up by the object, and its
    allocation count is kept in the Tag Pot. For example, a Page frame
    looks like:
     <p>
<PRE>
 ------------------
|//////////////////|
|//////////////////|
|//////////////////|
|///////Page///////|
|//////////////////|
|//////////////////|
|//////////////////|
 ------------------
</PRE>
<p>
<LI>
If the object is smaller than a Frame (for instance, a Node),
then the Object Frame is split into as many Objects as can
fit.  Each object in the frame has to keep track of all its own state,
and the Frame's Tag Pot allocation count is undefined (and
is used for optimization).  For example, a Node frame looks like:
<p>
<PRE>
 ------------------
|///////Node///////|
|\\\\\\\Node\\\\\\\|
|///////Node///////|
|\\\\\\\Node\\\\\\\|
|///////Node///////|
|\\\\\\\Node\\\\\\\|
|///////Node///////|
|                  |
 ------------------
</PRE>
</ul>
<h3>Allocation counts</h3>
<p>
If the allocation count of an object is N, that means that
there are no capabilities (other than resume capabilities)
containing the object's OID and an allocation count M > N, and
there are no <em>rescinded</em> capabilities (other than resume capabilities)
containing the object's OID and an allocation count M = N. 
(There may exist
rescinded capabilities (other than resume capabilities) containing
the object's OID and an allocation count less than N.)
<p>
In the simple case, rescinding capabilities to an object requires incrementing
the allocation count of the object. 
To reduce the "wear" on the allocation count, we keep track of some
in-memory capabilities (they are linked to the object) 
and we can invalidate these capabilities without incrementing the
allocation count. 
A bit called <em>allocCountUsed</em> indicates whether there may be unrescinded
 capabilities (other than resume capabilities)
 that contain the current value of the allocation count.
If the bit indicates that there are no such capabilities,
rescinding can be done without incrementing the allocation count.
<p>
Likewise, if the call count of an object is N, that means that
there are no resume capabilities
containing the object's OID and a call count M > N, and
there are no <em>rescinded</em> resume capabilities
containing the object's OID and a call count M = N. 
(There may exist rescinded resume capabilities containing
the object's OID and a call count less than N.)
And there is a <em>callCountUsed</em> bit.
<h3>Tag Pots</h3>
<p>
A tag pot has an entry for each frame in its cluster.
Each entry has the following fields:
<dl>
<dt><b>type</b>
<dd>The type says whether the frame contains a page or nodes.
In the future other types may be implemented (process is high on our list).
<p>A virgin frame should be typed as a page, since it is easier to
retype a page to a different type than vice versa.
<p>If we store bits telling whether there exist non-rescinded capabilities
containing the page's OID and the current allocation count, they could go here.
<dt><b>allocationCount</b>
<dd>If the frame holds a page, this is its allocation count.
If there were other types with only one object per frame,
this field might hold the allocation count for that object too.
<p><em>For nodes, is there any benefit to storing here the maximum allocation
count of the nodes in the frame?</em>
<dt><b>callCount</b>
<dd>If the frame holds a page, this is its call count.
If there were other types with only one object per frame,
this field might hold the call count for that object too.
If there were other types that do not increment the call count,
this field would hold the call count for those objects too,
since all the objects in the frame will have the same call count.
<p><em>For nodes, is there any benefit to storing here the maximum call
count of the nodes in the frame?</em>
<dt><b>allocCountUsed</b>
<dd>The allocCountUsed field indicates whether there may be unrescinded
 capabilities
 (other than resume capabilities) that have the same value for the allocCount.
<dt><b>callCountUsed</b>
<dd>The callCountUsed field indicates whether there may be unrescinded
 resume capabilities that have the same value for the callCount.
</dl>
<p>
To avoid wasting space on alignment, a tag pot is arranged as two arrays:
<pre>
struct TagPot {
  struct {
    ObCount allocationCount;
    ObCount callCount;
  } [];
  uint8_t type [];
};
</pre>
<p>
Using 32-bit counts, a tag pot can describe 455 object frames.
<h3>Retyping</h3>
<p>
It is possible to change the base type of a frame,
for example from page to node pot or vice versa.
By "base type" we mean the type of the container of an object.
For example, forwarders and GPTs are different types, but, as an
implementation detail, they both occupy a node frame;
they both are of base type node.
<p>
The space bank internally allocates a whole frame at a time to a given
base type. 
The space bank does not always know the base type of free frames,
and allocating the first object in a frame may require changing its type.
(As an optimization, the space bank preferentially allocates free frames
that were previously of the same base type, to reduce the amount of retyping
needed.)
<p>
Retyping a frame must not cause any rescinded capabilities to become
unrescinded.
Therefore the allocation count and call count of the new objects
must be set to the <em>maximum</em> of the respective counts of
all the old objects in the frame.
<p>Note that even pages must have call counts, because if a frame is retyped
from nodes to page and back to nodes, we must ensure that resume capabilities
don't become unrescinded.
<p>Retyping a frame involves the following steps. These steps ensure that
the retyping operation does not change the state of the last
committed checkpoint.
The steps are described in the context of a persistent (checkpointed) system,
but they apply equally well to a non-persistent (embedded) system.
<ol>
  <li>The space bank invokes a Range capability to request a capability
  to an object in the frame. The kernel attempts to find the requested
  object, and discovers that the frame is of the wrong type.
  The Range operation returns an exception that tells the space bank
  to retype the frame, and returns the current type of the frame. 
  <p>Note that the kernel needs to know the current type of the frame. 
  <ul>
    <li>For objects whose source has a backing store
    (i.e. a range on a mass medium
    such as a disk), the kernel simply looks for the object in all the usual
    places (in memory, in the in-core log directory, or in the home range),
    but only to get the type, not the contents of the object. 
    <li>For objects in a non-persistent range such as
    preloaded data or ROM-backed data, uninitialized frames are initially given
    whatever type is first requested. 
    After that, the frame's objects must remain in memory
    (even if they are null), so their type can be known.
  </ul>
  <li>The space bank only allocates objects of the same base type in a frame.
  Therefore in this situation there are no allocated
  objects in the frame. Therefore there should be no unrescinded capabilities
  to objects in the frame.
  Therefore the allocCountUsed and callCountUsed bits of those objects
  should be zero.
  <li>Knowing the type of the frame, the space bank now knows the number
  of objects in the frame. It determines the maximum allocation and call counts
  by iterating over all the objects in the frame, invoking
  a Range capability operation to get the current counts.
  Note, the allocation and call counts should not be changing,
  because the space bank
  has not yet allocated anything from the frame.
  <p>
  As with obtaining the type, the counts are obtained
  without requiring the contents of the object
  (in the case of a page, the contents of the page need not be fetched).
  Specifically, the kernel
  gets the counts (1) if the object is in memory, from the object header;
  (2) if the object is in the in-core log directory, from the directory entry;
  or (3) otherwise, from the home range tag pot (for a page)
  or home range node pot (for nodes).
  <p>There is a separate operation for each object, because each object
  might be in a different node pot in the log, and we don't want to
  require all the pots to be in memory at once.
  (This function could be optimized later to return counts for multiple
  objects in one operation, as long as that can be done
  without doing multiple fetches of pots on any one operation.)

  <p>In the case of nodes, the EROS design called for keeping in the tag pot
  the maximum of the allocation counts of the nodes in that home node pot.
  (That design would need to keep the maximum call count as well.)
  Note that this maximum only applies to the nodes whose current version is
  in the home node pot; some nodes from that pot might have their current
  version in log pots, and we still need to read those.
  This design could save reading the home node pot when the frame is retyped,
  but may require updating and writing the tag pot more frequently.
  Since retyping should be rare, we choose to not keep node counts
  in the tag pot. 
  <li>The space bank then invokes an operation on the Range capability to
  retype the frame.
  This is a separate operation from the above,
  to avoid requiring all the needed objects in memory at once.
  This operation proceeds in three phases.
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure we have enough resources to complete the operation.
    <li>Destroy vestiges of the old objects.
    If the object is in memory, we free it.
    Also, if the object is in the in-core log directory (for any generation),
    we free that directory entry.
    <li>Create nascent objects of the new type, for all objects in the frame.
    For persistent objects,
    these are created by making entries in the in-core directory
    (for the working generation) indicating that the objects are null.
    For non-persistent objects, the objects are created as null in memory
    (non-persistent objects never have directory entries).
    The allocation and call counts are specified by the space bank
    based on its earlier determination of the maximum counts.
    (It is likely that the space bank will soon allocate at least some
    of these objects.)
  </ol>
  <li>Eventually, one or more of the new objects, if persistent,
  will be migrated.
  The migrator notices the change of type in the tag pot in the home range.
  If the frame is now a node pot, the migrator formats the frame as such
  before migrating to it.
  The contents and counts of the nodes formatted in this frame
  do not actually matter, because all the nodes in it were dirtied
  and will be migrated to it either now or later.
</ol>
