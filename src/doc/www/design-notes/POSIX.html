  <h1>UNIX Compatibility Notes</h1>
</center>
<p> Some of the applications we want to port are POSIX-based, so we
have set up a UNIX compatibility environment.  Many (though certainly
not all) UNIX applications will cross-compile fairly readily.
<p> The compability library makes a number of assumptions about the
use of capability registers and other parts of the environment, which
are documented here.
