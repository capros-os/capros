      <H1>A Plan for Booting CapROS using Multiboot</H1>

    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11700357">
    This email thread</a> suggests changing CapROS to use the
    Multiboot specification supported by the GRUB boot loader. 
    Here is how I think that can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, a Multiboot header must be included near the beginning of
    the kernel image.
    This could be in lostart.S. 
    (I don't know how GRUB locates the Multiboot header; perhaps by
    searching for the magic number?) 
    </p>
    <p>
    GRUB can locate objects to load in two ways. 
    One is via a file name. Since CapROS doesn't have a file system
    that GRUB would understand, this won't work for us. We could dummy up a 
    file system containing the few files that GRUB needs to load,
    but that would be a pain. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The other way is as absolute block numbers. Since the location
    and size of the kernel vary, the block numbers can't be
    fixed in the GRUB menu. I propose that we have a GRUB
    configuration file located at a fixed block (such as 1; the
    VolHdr is in block 0).
    GRUB can load this with the <b>configfile</b> command.
    A CapROS tool, perhaps <b>mkvol</b>, would construct the 
    configuration file using the block numbers of the kernel division
    and preloaded division(s). <b>setboot</b> would no longer be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    To maintain consistency, there needs to be a primary config file
    (referring to the primary kernel and preloaded ranges)
    and a secondary config file (say at absolute block 2)
    referring to the secondary kernel and preloaded ranges.
    You keep one set consistent and unchanged while (non-atomically)
    updating the other set. 
    </p>
    <p>
    (We can't write to the kernel division the kernel a.out or ELF
    file (which GRUB understands); we must write an image as is now done
    because the division is a page range that has an extra frame every
    DATA_PAGES_PER_PAGE_CLUSTER pages.) 
    </p>
    <p>
    I think we can drop support for booting from RAM disk. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The Multiboot specification provides some, but not all, of the information
    the kernel currently gets in the BootInfo structure. (I'm assuming that
    GRUB actually provides all the information specified as optional
    in the Multiboot specification, but I haven't verified this.)
    The following fields in BootInfo have issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>bootStartSec, isRamImage: only used during boot, not used by the kernel
      <li>memInfo: GRUB provides information on available RAM.
      The kernel now uses only this information.
      <li>divInfo (information for preloaded divisions):
      CapROS needs more information than is provided by GRUB. 
      Possibly this information can be passed to the kernel
      in the string given with the GRUB "module" command. 
      <li>consInfo: not currently used by the kernel
      <li>volFlags, iplSysId, iplKey: the kernel could get these
      from the VolHdr of the booted volume, but since the kernel
      doesn't do disk I/O, that could be awkward. Better to pass the info
      in the GRUB "command line" string. 
    </ul>
