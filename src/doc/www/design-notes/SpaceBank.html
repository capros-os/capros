  <H1>Space Bank Design</H1>
</center>
This note describes the new design of the Space Bank, which is in
response to the new conglomerated design for Object Ranges.  Readers
should already be familiar with the structure of EROS volumes, which
is described in the <a href="DiskFormatting.html">Disk Formatting and
Layout</a> design note.

<H2>1 Object Identifiers and Range Keys </H2>

<p>
Every object has a unique object identifier, which consists of an
object frame number and an object number within that frame.  The
number of valid objects per frame depends on the type of the objects
currently residing in that frame.  The object number field is
currently 5 bits, but this will probably be revised to 8 soon.
<p>
<PRE>
 -----------------------------------------------------------
|             Object Frame #              | Obj # w/i Frame |
 -----------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<p>
To create a new object, the space bank hands such object identifier to
a range capability and asks for an object capability.  The created
object's <em>true</em> OID will be relative to the base of the range.
Since the space bank uses the superrange capability, it proves that it
deals in true object identifiers, but this is not necessary to the
design of the space bank; a correct design could be implemented using
multiple range capabilities.  The KeyKOS space bank was in fact
implemented that way.
<P>
A <em>range capability</em> conveys the authority to create and recind
keys to objects of any type within its range by passing the offset
OID.  If asked to create a key to an object in a frame of a different
type than that of the current type of the frame, all objects currently
in the frame are rescinded, and the frame is reinitialized to the new
type.  <em>Caveat emptor</em>.  While it is common practice to have a
one-to-one correspondance between range capabilities and disk ranges,
adjacent ranges can be coalesced into a single range capability.
<p>
The space bank holds a range capability for each range that it is to
manage.  More precisely, the space bank is <em>handed</em> a range
capability for each range it is to manage when when the range is
fabricated.  To simplify the internal design (which is plenty
complicated enough, as you will see), the space bank used a single
superrange capability conveying the authority to fabricate
<em>any</em> object, and keeps track internally of which areas are
``live.''
<H2>2  Functional Overview </H2>
<p>
Before describing the space bank design, it may be useful to have a
sense of what function the space bank provides and what requirements
the design must meet.   The current design (which is the one described
here) is a compromise on these requirements.
<h3>2.1 Space Bank Services</h3>
<p>
The Space Bank handles allocation and deallocation of all EROS
objects, which includes pages, nodes, cappages, and processes.
Collectively, all of the space banks in the system conspire to keep a
globally up to date list of the available object frames, and dole
these out to individual banks as needed.  Every space bank has a
parent, all of which are ultimately descended from the <b>prime space
bank</b>.
<ul>
  <em>From a functional perspective, all banks are rooted at the prime
  bank.  For convenience of internal implementation, there is a
  co-equal internal bank known as <b>bank0</b> that is used by the
  space bank itself to allocate internal storage.</em>
</ul>
<p>
The most common operations requested of a space bank are the
<b>allocate</b> and <b>deallocate</b> operations.  The <b>allocate</b>
operation is on the fault handling path for heap and stack growth.
Since heap growth is a performance critical operation for many
programs, the allocate operation is especially time critical.
<p>
Every bank retains a list of the objects that it has allocated.  This
list is used for two purposes:
<ul>
  <li> To verify that returned objects were actually allocated by this
       bank.
       <p>
  <li> To allow <em>all</em> of the objects allocated by the space
       bank to be rescinded when the bank is destroyed.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
The second item brings us to the second facility that space banks
provide: the <b>destroy</b> operation.  When a space bank is
destroyed, it (and all of its children) becomes unusable, and all
capabilities to the bank are invalidated.  The objects allocated by
these banks can be handled in two ways, depending on <em>how</em> the
bank was destroyed:
<ul>
  <li> They can be rescinded.
       <p>
  <li> They can be inherited upwards to the parent of the destroyed
       bank.
       <p>
</ul>
<p>
The first case (everything rescinded) is a useful way to perform
recovery cleanup when an orderly cleanup has become impossible.  The
second provides a way to do speculative allocation of objects where
the result once constructed is to be retained, but allows the interim
construct to be easily discarded if the available space proves
insufficient.
<h3>2.2 Bank Restrictions</h3>
<p>
Space banks impose two restrictions: limits and nodestroy.
<p>
Every bank imposes a <b>limit</b> that describes the total number of
object frames that can be allocated via a given bank.  When an object
frame is allocated by a bank, it is logically allocated (recursively)
by all of its parent banks as well.  The applicable limit value is
therefore the <em>most constraining</em> of the limits of all of the
parent banks up to the prime bank.  The limit field provides a way to
restrict the resource allocation of subsystems.  A common use is for
there to exist a limited bank whose children impose no limit.
<p>
The limit is simply a counter, and can be reset on demand.  Every bank
therefore provides the ability to create a restricted capability to
the same bank that precludes changes to the limit field.  The limit of
a limit-restricted bank cannot be altered.
<p>
For similar reasons, it is sometimes useful to ensure that a space
bank cannot be destroyed.  For example, the space bank containing all
of the space available to a given user should probably be
nondestructible, lest the user accidentally destroy <em>all</em> of
their storage (which would be nonrecoverable).  As with
limit-restricted banks, every bank can create a restricted capability
to the same bank that precludes bank destruction.
<p>
The two restrictions are independent; a given bank capability can
enforce one, the other, or neither.
<h3>2.3 Other Requirements</h3>
<p>
While the description given so far makes the bank functionality seem
straightforward, there are a number of complications that make the
actual implementation complex:
<UL>
  <li> The number of available frames in a large system cannot be
       described within a single address space; the space bank must
       carefully husband its virtual address space to maximize the
       amount of space it is able to handle. <em>The current design
       does not go as far in this direction as we would like.</em>
       <p>
  <li>
       The global free list must be coordinated across banks.  This
       requires a sleazy implementation trick.
       <p>
  <li>
       Fabrication of a child bank should be relatively light weight
       and require minimal essential overhead, since the bank
       mechanism is used to simplify storage reclamation in the face
       of an allocation error.
       <p>
  <LI> Allocating space needs to be *FAST* -- allocation is a frequent
       operation on the critical path of many programs.  Once in to
       the space bank proper, the time to allocate an object really
       wants to be in the 1 to 2 microsecond range.
       <p>
  <LI> All allocated objects must be accounted for -- no loosing objects
       for efficiency's sake.
       <p>
  <LI> Objects allocated by a given space bank should have good
       locality of reference.  Disk locality is a significant
       contributor to overall system performance.
       <p>
  <LI><I>not implemented</I> There should be ways for a program to
       reserve a large amount of space for efficiency purposes (database
       programs, etc)
</UL>
<p>
Some other items should be noted as <em>not</em> being requrements:
<UL>
  <LI> The space bank is *not* a garbage collector.  If you allocated an
       object, and lost the key, that is your problem.
       <p>
  <LI> The space bank is *not* a real bank.  You cannot hold up the
       space bank.
<p>
</UL>
<h2>3 The Implementation</h2>
<p>
The bank itself is fairly straightforward but for our sensitivity to
address space size limits.  The major complexity of the space bank
comes from the requirement for high-performance, clustered allocation.
We will describe the overall design and the individual bank
mechanisms, and then discuss how fast, well-localized allocation is
managed.
<h3>3.1 Structure</h3>
<p>
While there are many space banks, the actual implementation uses only
one process.  Each individual space bank is actually a red segment
node containing a start key to the bank process and some auxiliary
information identifying the bank instance and the applicable
restrictions.  In effect, the format capability of the red segment
node is used to gain the effect of a large number of objects (the
banks) implemented by a single server (the bank process).  In actual
practice, the distinguishing "bank identifier" stored in the red
segment node is simply a pointer to a bank structure within the
virtual address space of the bank process.
<p>
A side effect of this design is mutual exclusion -- because there is
only one bank process, it is guaranteed that access to the global free
frame list is single-threaded.  Further, there is no need to manage
the master list across multiple processes.
<p>
A single prime space bank is not a requirement of this design.  It
would be quite possible to implement a design in which there were
multiple banks representing the roots of distinct bank hierarchies.
<h3>3.2 Per-Bank Information</h3>
<p>
Internally, the space bank process maintains a number of
<code>Bank</code> structures allocated from the heap.  Every bank has
a pointer to its parent bank, the next sibling in it's generation, and
it's first child bank (if any).
<p>
Each bank has several restricted variants, and a separate red segment
node is fabricated for each.  The bank keeps track of which restricted
variants have been fabricated and what the node OID was for that
variant, and reuses these nodes rather than fabricating new ones for
each request for restriction.
<p>
The most essential information carried by the bank is the list of
objects that it has allocated.  This is kept in a balanced binary
tree, but here overhead becomes a problem. If every OID is stored in a
separate tree node, the node overhead is 200%.  Obviously this will
not do.
<p>
The first saving grace lies in the fact that nodes and processes are
smaller than a page frame, and that a given page frame can only hold
objects of a single type.  This allows us to implement tree nodes
containing a page frame OID and a bitmap describing which of the
contained objects is allocated.  This somewhat reduces the tree
overhead.
<p>
A larger savings comes from ``clumping'' the tree nodes into multiple
page frames.  We know that the bank must obtain well-localized
allocation for performance reasons.  We bet that it will, and design
the tree nodes to describe 8 adjacent frames using a single OID.  This
yields a substantial reduction in overhead, but its effectiveness will
need to be examined.
<p>
Finally, the bank must manage the fact that a given disk frame can
only hold objects of a single type.  When a node is allocated
into a new frame, the bank keeps track of the current frame for node
allocation, and continues to use that frame until it is exhausted.
<h3>3.3 Range Management</h3>
<p>
The space bank maintains a list of active ranges.  In the current
implementation, this is a statically allocated list, but future
versions will provide means for the list to grow.  Each element in the
range list describes a starting and ending OID.  The current
implementation can manage up to 4096 ranges.
<p>
In order to simplify the management of the master list of available
frames, ranges are coalesced into a single numbering scheme; each new
range is added at a start number that is congruent mod 32K to 0.  This
ensures that the bitmap of available frames in that range can come
from within the range itself.  The space bank preallocates a master
bitmap that holds all ranges, and plugs the new objects into this
master range as they become available.
<h3>3.4 Free Frame Management</h3>
<p>
<h3>3.5 Minor Complications</h3>
<p>

<H3>How it does all this</H3>

<I><B>NOTE ON BANK STRUCTURE (parent/child)</B></I>
The underpinnings of the space bank are two structures, the Global
Range Directories and the per-bank allocation maps.  These function
together to keep track of all storage (allocated and unallocated)
managed by the Space Bank.

    <H4>Global Range Directories</H4>

Each range is seen by the space bank to be a number of object frames.
In order to keep track of what has been allocated, it needs to have a
bitmap, called a "range map", which has one bit for each frame in the
range, which keeps track of its allocation status. Since searching
through a large bitmap is very slow, the range map is divided into
page-size chunks, called "sub-range map"s.  In order to quickly find a
sub-range map which is not completely allocated, there is a "Range
directory", which has one bit for every sub-range map which keeps
track of whether it is completely allocated.  

<BR><I><B>figure "RangeMap.fig" here</B></I>
<BR>
<P>

In the Range, the Directory occupies the first couple frames, and the
sub-range maps take up the following few frames, and the allocatable
frames take up the rest of the disk.  (It would take a 4 Terabyte disk
to get the Range Directory larger than a single frame)

<PRE>

 Range
 ----------------------------------------
|Dir|Map|Map|...|Map|Frm|Frm|Frm|Frm|...
 ----------------------------------------
</pre>

    <H4>Per-bank allocation map</H4>

Each bank has to keep track of all storage allocated by it, for two reasons:

<UL>
<LI> A bank can be asked to destroy itself and all of its contents.
<LI> If someone asks a bank to deallocate an object which wasn't 
     allocated from the bank, it must be refused.
</UL>
