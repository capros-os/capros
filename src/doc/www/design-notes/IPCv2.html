  <h1>Revised IPC Design</h1>
</center>
<p> This note describes the second iteration of the EROS IPC
interface.  The revised IPC iterates on the first design to improve
the performance of some common cases.  The change itself isn't
especially earth shattering, but thinking through the implementation
on a register starved architecture was tricky.
<h2>1. The Original IPC</h2>
<p> The first-round EROS IPC mechanism had the following interface:
<center>
  <table width=85%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Invocation</strong></td>
      <td>Call, Return, or Fork + key space address of key to be
	invoked</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Entry Block</strong></td>
      <td>Opcode, Slot numbers of the four keys to be sent, xmit data
	buffer pointer, xmit data buffer length.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Exit Block</strong></td>
      <td>Opcode, Slot numbers of the four key slots to be
	overwritten, rcv data buffer pointer, rcv data limit.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> On return, the entry receive limit field is overwritten with
<code>min(send_len,rcv_len)</code>, and the 16 bit <em>key
data</em> field of the invoked key is provided to the receiver.  The
send length is limited to 65535 bytes.
<p> This interface suffers from a number of unfortunate limitations:
<ul>
  <li> The 65535 limit is awkward.  It would be preferable to permit a
       65536 (or more generally some bounded power of 2) limit.
       On register starved architectures the send and receive
       length fields were regrettably limited to 16 bits.
       <p>
  <li> In many cases the buffer wants to be accompanied by a word or
       two of descriptive information in addition to the opcode, such
       as an object descriptor.  The lack of data words in addition to
       the buffer was forcing a marginal copy of the data buffer.
       <p>
  <li> OS emulation was complicated by the need to contiguize (if
       that's a word) the data.  Many UNIX and Win32 system calls
       consist of a few arguments plus a single buffer.  The marginal
       copy was hurting (this is really the previous case in
       disguise).
       <p> 
  <li> Several performance-critical invocations, most notably of the
       space bank and the segment keeper, required a data buffer to
       transmit the values of one or two registers.  Unfortunately,
       the overhead of validating the receive and send areas greatly
       increases the message transfer cost.  On a 120Mhz Pentium, the
       cost goes from 2.4us (no buffer) to 3.5us.  While this may not
       seem like a lot, the marginal cost is entirely memory delay,
       and will not scale with processor speed.
       <p>
</ul>
<p> In consequence, we have redesigned the IPC interface.  The new
interface transmits more information for essentially the same cost.
For the most part, we have achieved this by trading off the cost of
field extraction for cache-resident data motion.  The resulting
interface is a bit slower in low frequency cases, but considerably
faster in the cases that prove to matter.
<h2>2. The Revised Interface</h2>
<p> The revised EROS IPC mechanism has the following interface:
<center>
  <table width=85%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Invocation</strong></td>
      <td>Call, Return, or Fork + key space address of key to be
	invoked, number of registers sent and received.</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Entry Block</strong></td>
      <td>Four registers to be sent, Slot numbers of the four
	keys to be sent, xmit data buffer pointer, xmit data buffer
	length.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>Exit Block</strong></td>
      <td>Four registers to be received, Slot numbers of the
	four key slots to be overwritten, rcv data buffer pointer, rcv
	data limit.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> In the new interface, the receive buffer length has been extended
to a 32 bit field.  While the current interface restricts the transfer
to 64K, this limit could be compatibly increased in future
implementations.
<p> On register rich architectures, including most RISC machines,
there is no problem with taking up more registers.  While the sender
must save/restore and zero any of the transmitted registers that it
does not wish to transmit, there are several ameliorating
considerations:
<ul>
  <li> The save and restore are cache-resident with high likelihood.
  <li> Given cache residence, the marginal cost of the save and
       restore are balanced by a marginal savings obtained by
       eliminating some bitfield extraction instructions in the kernel
       IPC path.
  <li> Many performance-critical cases that previously required a data
       buffer no longer require one.  Memory latency is bad, so this
       is a good tradeoff.
</ul>
<h2>3. Impact on Register-Poor Architectures</h2>
<p> The main problem with this change is the impact on register-poor
architectures.  Since the most widely deployed processor (x86) is
register poor, this bares thinking on.  Since the x86 is probably the
<em>most</em> register impoverished architecture, we will describe the
implementation for the x86 and leave it to the reader to adapt to
similarly deficient architectures.  
<p> The main complication is that those invocations that do
<em>not</em> require a data buffer should be executable from a
read-only address space.  While this is not the common case, there is
some bootstrap code in the EROS system that must be able to run in an
immutable space to support certain confinement and security arguments.
This means that any values that are mutated as a side-effect of the
IPC (receive length, key data) must reside in registers.  In addition,
the opcode and return code should reside in registers, though it is
acceptable for them to be mapped to the same register.
<p> The x86 provides only eight user-mode registers: %EAX, %EBX, %ECX,
%EDX, %ESI, %EDI, %EBP, and %ESP.  With the exception of %ESP, all of
these registers can be modified as part of the calling convention, and
even %ESP can safely be used as a general-purpose register in an
immutable address space.  Modifying %EBP presents a challenge to
debuggers.  This is extremely unfortunate, but in practice the IPC
trap is a readily identifiable leaf procedure, and can be recognized
by the debugger as a special case (as a recovering debugger architect,
I confess that this makes me shudder).
<p> On the x86, the hardware will copy values off of the stack on
entry into the kernel when performing a privilege crossing
<code>CALL</code> instruction.  This allows us to place the send data
pointer, send data length, sent key slots, receive key slots, and
receive data pointer on the stack.  The remaining values are mapped to
registers as follows:
<p> 
<center>
  <table width=85%>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>%EAX .. %EDX</strong></td>
      <td>Copied registers.  By convention, %EAX holds the opcode on
	entry and the result code on exit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>%EBP</strong></td>
      <td>Key register numbers of invoked key and <em>received</em>,
	assembled by concatenation:
<pre>
&lt;zeros&gt;:InvokedKey:rk3:rk2:rk1:rk0
</pre>
	Note that rk0 appears at the least significant bit position.
	Because the received keys of the sender are not used in the
	fast path, this layout has performance advantages.  Once the
	register is saved to the save area it can be shifted in place.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>%ESI</strong></td>
      <td>Send key registers, assembled by concatenation:
<pre>
&lt;zeros&gt;:sk3:sk2:sk1:sk0
</pre>
	On exit, this register holds the <strong>key info</strong>
	field of the invoked gate key (if any) or zero.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td><strong>%EDI</strong></td>
      <td>Receive length limit on entry, actual length on exit.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> The invocation type (call, return, send) is determined by the
kernel entry point. The stack pointer (<code>%ESP</code>) points to a
structure of the form:
<ul>
  <pre>
  struct InvInfo {
    Word invType;   /* IT_CALL, IT_SEND, or IT_RECEIVE */
    Byte *sndPtr;
    Word sndLen;
    Byte *rcvPtr;
  };
  </pre>
</ul>
<p> In an immutable address space, this data structure must be
suitably pre-allocated, and the stack pointer must be set to point to
the instance appropriate to the invocation in question.  While the
sndKeys and rcvKeys fields could be combined, the cost of the marignal
shift and mask makes this a wash.  Better to keep it simple.
<p> Originally, I thought it worthwhile to have a limit on the number
of registers transferred or received so as to give the process at
least <em>one</em> register that is not mutated by IPC.  For the most
part this is only a problem in immutable address spaces. If it proves
necessary, the applicable limits should be appended to the InvInfo
structure. In practice, it turned out that only the process
construction/destruction code needs to do even as much as a loop
structure while making calls.  This loop can simply be unwound, so I
decided to stick with the current interface and avoid the additional
test in the IPC path.
