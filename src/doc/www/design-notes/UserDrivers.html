    <h1>Device Drivers</h1>
    <p>
       The ability to port drivers from Linux is very important, because
       there are very many drivers. The ability to port them with
       minimal changes is important because they are said to have
       a high rate of change. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Device drivers, in most cases, have the same security properties
      as the kernel - they must be trusted by everyone,
      because they direct hardware that on most architectures
      has write access to all of physical memory. 
      In KeyKOS and early versions of EROS, device drivers executed
      as part of the kernel. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are several advantages to having drivers execute
      in user processes:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      It's easier to write a program to run in user mode than in the kernel.
    </li>
    <li>
      User mode provides some protection from accidental damage. 
    </li>
    <li>
      To port drivers from Linux with a minimum of rewriting, you need to
      run them in an environment that looks like the Linux kernel
      (with, for example, a per-process stack). 
      Building such an environment is, like most everything, easier
      in processes than in the kernel. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If a GPL-licensed driver is linked with the kernel, 
      there is an argument that the kernel is at risk of being considered
      a derived work of the driver and therefore subject to GPL.
      Placing the driver in a user-mode process reduces this risk.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also some disadvantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      There is a performance cost in putting drivers
      outside the kernel, as there is for most code. 
      But today, virtually all devices are architected in a way
      (such as using DMA) that 
      does not place a high penalty on user-mode drivers .
      See <a href="http://www.coyotos.org/pipermail/coyotos-dev/2005-October/000181.html">
      this email thread</a> for a discussion of this.
    </li>
    <li>
      Linux drivers are already designed to run in a kernel;
      running them in a user process is an additional change required
      to port them. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The decision in CapROS is to run virtually all drivers in user processes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers will of course be granted whatever
      privileges are needed to do their job (this is architecture-dependent). 
      The DevicePrivs key allows drivers to field interrupts
      and (together with a Range key) access memory containing device registers.
      The DevicePrivs key will also make it possible for a driver
      to obtain contiguous physical memory for use with DMA. 
    </p>
    <h1>Page Fault Handler</h1>
    <p>
      The Page Fault Handler (PFH) is defined as all the user objects which 
      could be needed to service requests (from the kernel) to fetch and
      write pages and nodes from or to backing store. This includes
      the process that fields those requests,
      any other processes that service those requests,
      the process(es) that service backing store device interrupts,
      all the code and data used by those processes,
      and any other pages and nodes used by those processes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Backing store is usually disk, but the PFH is not exactly the same
      as the disk driver. The PFH includes any objects used to handle
      the buses by which the backing store is accessed, such as PCI,
      USB, Firewire, or even Ethernet. The PFH excludes any part of the
      disk driver that is used to service user requests (for example,
      querying statistics) but not used to service kernel requests. 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h1>Persistence and Non-Persistence</h1>
    <p>
      The CapROS model is that user data and capabilities are persistent,
      meaning their state is preserved even when the system is rebooted.
      Persistence is accomplished by checkpointing the state to 
      nonvolatile backing storage. 
      By checkpointing all user state, we
      assure that the security state (the state of the capabilities)
      is valid and consistent. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is that the PFH, though part of the user state, 
      cannot be persistent, for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      The PFH obviously cannot load itself, so it must be loaded by the
      boot loader. 
      Available boot loaders can't decipher the checkpoint log
      to find the correct version of the data to load. 
    </li>
    <li>
      It is awkward, though theoretically possible,
      for the PFH to checkpoint itself.
      At a checkpoint, we would do copy-on-write of the PFH data
      (this logic will exist anyway). 
      It would be necessary to ensure that enough available memory
      exists to do all the copies in memory. 
      Making the PFH non-persistent removes this constraint. 
    </li>
    <li>
      There is little reason for the PFH (or other drivers for that matter)
      to be persistent,
      because on reboot the device state is either reset or unknown.
      Drivers could in theory use something like the KeyKOS journaling
      mechanism to remember the device state, but this mechanism
      is generally better applied at a higher level. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore, we must declare that some user state is non-persistent. 
      Non-persistent objects will live in OID ranges that are marked as such.
      These ranges will be loaded by the boot loader
      (in GRUB, they are considered to be "modules").
      Non-persistent objects must never be cleaned, checkpointed, or written
      back to disk. 
      They must never be removed from memory. 
      (It may prove useful to allow non-persistent objects to be
      <i>explicitly</i> released from memory, after a configuration
      procedure has determined they are not needed.) 
    </p>
    <h2>Classes of Objects</h2>
    <p>
      We can now identify four different classes of objects:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>
The PFH, which is non-persistent.
</li>
<li>
Non-persistent objects other than the PFH.
We want to limit the number of non-persistent objects, if only because
they cannot be paged out, but will probably put all device drivers
(other than the PFH) in this class just for consistency.
</li>
<li>
Persistent objects that are pinned (locked in memory).
We want to limit the number of pinned objects because they use
physical memory which is a limited resource. 
Persistent objects may need to be pinned if they are referenced by the PFH.
Note that immediately after a restart from checkpoint, class 3 is empty, 
because no persistent objects have been fetched from backing store yet, 
let alone pinned.
</li>
<li>
Persistent objects that are not pinned.
All normal user objects fall into this class.
</li>
</ol>
    <p>
      Note that objects move between classes 3 and 4 as they are
      pinned and unpinned. 
      And an object in class 2 effectively moves to class 1 while
      it holds a lock that is also used by the PFH. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that if the system is configured as a
      diskless or "embedded" system, the entire system is non-persistent. 
      Such systems need not be considered further here.
    </p>
<h1>Consistency</h1>
    <p>
      We said above that the system takes checkpoints to ensure
      the consistency (including security) of the user data.
      Now the question is, what is the consistency contract between
      the persistent and non-persistent worlds? For example, we want
      to avoid scenarios such as the following :
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      A persistent user process P calls a driver. The driver receives a 
      resume key to P.
    </li>
    <li>
      A checkpoint is taken and a restart occurs. Because the driver is
      non-persistent, it reverts to its initial state
      and loses the resume key. It never returns to process P. 
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Capability Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Here are the design constraints for the interaction of the four
      classes of objects.
    </p>
    <h3>Deadlock when Fetching</h3>
    <p>
      The PFH must never reference unpinned objects, because that
      would lead to a deadlock. 
      (It is permissible to have a capability to such an object,
      as long as it is never used.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The PFH may read persistent pinned objects, but must never write them. 
      The reason is that at the instant a checkpoint is taken, persistent
      objects are made temporarily read-only until their state can be saved.
      Saving the state may require using the PFH. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that the PFH cannot use a gate key to any persistent
      process. 
      A process should not CALL a start key to the PFH,
      because the PFH must not receive and use the resume key. 
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, the PFH could be designed to handle its own page faults
      recursively. There needs to be some limit on the depth of recursion.
      For simplicity, we will design with no recursion. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another constraint applies to locks (such as semaphores, mutexes,
      or spinlocks) that are used by the PFH. 
      While holding such a lock, a process must obey the same rules as the PFH.
    </p>
    <h3>Deadlock when Cleaning</h3>
    <p>
      When the kernel allocates a page frame, if space is not available,
      it begins cleaning pages. Meanwhile the process requesting the space
      waits for the cleaning to finish. Similarly, when a node frame is
      needed, it may require cleaning nodes into a node pot,
      which in turn may require a page frame,
      which may require page cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the PFH needs to allocate a page frame, this could lead to deadlock.
      The PFH may allocate pages or nodes to expand heap space,
      or to build a mapping table (mapping tables are allocated
      from page frame space). 
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this problem, the kernel reserves a number of page frames
      (KTUNE_MapTabReserve) for mapping tables and for allocations by the PFH.
      If this number is large enough to guarantee that the PFH can
      finish cleaning, then the deadlock is eliminated.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Reset"></a>Reset</h3>
    <p>
      On a restart, the state of the non-persistent world is reset to its
      initial state. This means that any capabilities acquired during
      execution will be lost. 
      This should not be a problem for the 
      non-persistent world, because it will be initialized to
      a consistent state. However, a persistent object that expected
      to be invoked by a non-persistent object may wait forever. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We will solve this problem for resume keys. When the system
      takes a checkpoint, it will examine all non-persistent nodes. 
      For each resume key it finds to a persistent process,
      it will save the state of the
      waiting process such that if restarted from that state,
      the process will find that the CALL has returned with a
      distinctive reply code (RC_capros_key_Restart).
      Alternatively, it could save the state such that if restarted,
      the process will run and re-execute its CALL invocation. 
      Assuming that the CALL was directly to a non-persistent process,
      that cap will have been rescinded (see below), and the
      response from the now-void cap will signal the restart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that case, the operation that was requested by the CALL
      invocation may have partially completed before the last checkpoint,
      and partially or fully completed after the last checkpoint and
      before the restart.
      This behavior is unavoidable, because the system cannot in general
      checkpoint and roll back the state of I/O devices. 
      Programs that invoke I/O devices must be prepared to cope with
      this possibility. 
      In some cases, the driver can respond to the re-executed CALL
      by saying "the device is not now known to be in a state
      where you can perform that request (for example, not "open"). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Any keys other than resume keys will be dropped on restart.
      If a non-persistent object held a start capability to a
      persistent process, the persistent process will not be notified
      that the start capability has been dropped.
      As for security, it should be clear that dropping capabilities
      does not open any vulnerabilities. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-persistent objects in class 2 could be initialized with capabilities
      to persistent objects, but they must recognize that the
      persistent object's state may get out of sync.
    </p>
    <h3>Time Travel</h3>
    <p>
      Persistent objects may hold capabilities to non-persistent objects.
      A persistent process may hold and call a start key to an object
      in class 2.
      When the system is restarted,
      from the point of view of the persistent object,
      the non-persistent objects appear to travel backwards in time
      to their initial state. 
      To alert the persistent object that this has happened, on restart
      we will rescind all capabilites in persistent objects
      to non-persistent objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The effect of this is similar, from the point of view of the
      persistent world, to what would happen if the
      non-persistent world were created out of a single space bank,
      and on restart that bank were asked to reclaim all the space
      created from it. 
      Note that on restart, unlike the SpaceBank.destroySpace operation, 
      resume caps held in objects created under the bank will be
      effectively invoked with an error code.
      The equivalent KeyKOS space bank operation did invoke such
      resume caps, and we believe the CapROS bank should also.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be implemented as follows. During execution, 
      non-persistent objects may be allocated and rescinded as normal,
      from a space bank that allocates from a non-persistent range.
      This may result in incrementing the object's allocation count.
      We will keep track of the maximum allocation count or call count of any
      non-persistent object, and save that on a checkpoint.
      On restart, all non-persistent objects are given an allocation count
      and call count equal to that maximum plus one.
      All capabilities in persistent objects
      to non-persistent objects will thus be rescinded.
      Capabilities to non-persistent objects in non-persistent objects
      will be initialized to contain the new allocation count,
      so those capabilities will be valid. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two ways to calculate the maximum allocation/call count.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the first, we recognize that when an object's allocCountUsed
        bit is on, that object's allocation count will be incremented
        when the object is rescinded. The count saved on a checkpoint
        should be the count that results in rescinding all the
        non-persistent objects, so it should be based on the
        incremented count. 
      <li>
        In the second, we simply assume that the allocCountUsed bits
        of non-persistent objects are on, and save the maximum
        of the unincremented counts, plus one.
        This number may be larger than necessary, but it is safe.
    </ul>
      The second method may increment the maximum count faster than
      the first, but only by the number of restarts.
      We will implement the second method, because the first method
      requires more code, and therefore execution time, at the point when
      a capability is unprepared.
    <p>
      There is an implementation wrinkle. 
      On restart, we load and start the non-persistent processes,
      which then read the checkpoint headers. 
      We will have to initially load the non-persistent objects
      with zero allocation and call counts.
      Once the needed counts are read from the checkpoint headers,
      and before any persistent objects are loaded,
      we must adjust the counts of the already-loaded non-persistent objects.
    </p>
    <h1>Communication</h1>
    <p>
      The design for communication between the persistent
      and non-persistent worlds respects the severe limitations
      described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a persistent node called (for historical reasons) Volsize
      with a well-known OID (PVOLSIZE_OID which is 0x0100000000000000).
      A slot (volsize_nplinkCap) of this node contains a start capability
      to a persistent bridge process called NPLink (Non-Persistent Link). 
      Non-persistent drivers access the persistent Volsize node
      to obtain the capability to NPLink. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When a device, to which access is required from persistent objects,
      is recognized, either when the system is booted, or when the
      device is later attached to the system,
      the driver sends to the start cap to the NPLINK process
      a message containing a cap (the "device cap") (usually a start cap)
      to the non-persistent object (which must be in class 2)
      that provides access to the device.
      The NPLink process is responsible for granting this cap
      to the appropriate client of the device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication between the device and the client proceeds normally
      until the system restarts. Then,
      as described above, the device cap, and any other caps to
      non-persistent objects, which may have been derived from the
      device cap, are rescinded.
      The client will discover the rescission the next time it tries
      to use one of these caps, and will use that information
      to initiate whatever restart recovery is appropriate.
      If and when the device is present after the restart,
      a new device cap to it will be created and distributed once again
      as described above. 
    </p>
    <h2>Upgrading</h2>
    <p>
      This design allows either side of the interface to be upgraded,
      while protecting against the possibility of an unscheduled
      restart at any time.
      To upgrade the non-persistent side:
    </p>
<ol>
<li> Create the new non-persistent objects in the boot image.
This may be in a new non-persistent disk range.
<li> Set up the boot image so that when and if
the system is restarted, it will use the new objects.
To protect against a restart at any time, this must be atomic.
That is, there is a point X in time such that
a restart at any time, up to point X, will use the old objects,
and a restart at any time after point X will use the new objects.
<li> Create the new non-persistent objects in the running system,
and arrange to transfer operation from the old to the new objects.
Then destroy the old objects.
This step is no different than upgrading persistent objects. 
Alternatively, you may restart the system.
</ol>
    <p>
      Upgrading the persistent side can be done as follows:
    </p>
<ol>
<li> Create the new NPLink process.
<li> Overwrite the slot in the persistent Volsize node with the cap
to the new NPLink process.
<li> Ensure the old NPLink process is no longer being used. This can be done
by waiting for a sufficient time, or by rebooting the system.
<li> Destroy the old NPLink process.
</ol>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      Consider the driver for a USB mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouse is obviously not a paging device, but it interfaces
      with the USB bus, which may also have paging devices.
      In the current implementation, the USB host controller driver
      (which manages the bus) has dependencies on the USB device drivers.
      For example, if the mouse is unplugged, the mouse driver receives
      a notification, to which it must respond promptly.
      While processing such a notification, the mouse driver is in class 1,
      because a page fault may depend on the USB host controller driver
      which depends on the mouse driver.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because USB devices are hot-plugged, the driver is constructed
    as needed.
    The constructor has as a constituent a capability to the non-persistent
    Volsize node, which has a capability to the persistent Volsize node,
    which has a start capability to 
    the NPLink process. When a mouse is recognized (either when the
    system is booted, or when a device is plugged in),
    a driver is constructed, consisting of two processes (threads).
    One thread responds to requests from the USB bus handler, which it
    must do as class 1.
    The second thread will respond to requests
    from persistent processes for mouse I/O. 
    The second thread will be in class 2
    while it is receiving or replying to requests, and
    must not hold any locks needed by the first thread at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second thread passes to the NPLink process
    a start capability to itself, which we
    will call a mouse capability.
    If the mouse is unplugged, the driver rescinds the mouse cap.
    If the system restarts, the system rescinds the mouse cap.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Some drivers, such as the serial port driver, are totally separate
      from the PFH. They can be entirely in class 2. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A device driver could be divided into different parts,
      each in a different one of the four classes of objects. 
      In many cases a driver will need a persistent front end that presents
      a more usable interface to clients, and can handle multiple
      independent clients. 
      The only requirement is that any part used by the kernel for paging
      is part of the PFH and therefore must be non-persistent. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the simplest design is to have a part of the driver
      in class 2 that is the user interface, and the rest in class 1
      acting as a server for both the class 2 part and the kernel. 
      The user interface can pin (and unpin) user objects if it is necessary
      for the class 1 part to read them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another design issue concerns protection boundaries. 
      Class 3 objects have more authority than class 4 (because they can
      pin), and class 2 have more than class 3 (because they can
      cause time travel). We want to keep different authorities in
      different processes, and use gate keys to transfer control
      between them. For efficiency, we want to avoid the need for
      one gate jump from 4 to 3, and a second jump from 3 to 2. 
      (And possibly more from 2 to 1.) 
      In other words, we want to traverse the most authority change
      with the fewest gate jumps. 
      From class 4, we cannot call class 1, so calling class 2
      makes sense. 
    </p>
    <h1>Linux Userspace I/O drivers</h1>
    <p>
      Support for device drivers in user processes 
      was added to the Linux kernel in version 2.6.23-rc4 (drivers/uio). 
      We took a quick look at this feature and discovered the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      A small amount of code is still needed in the kernel to register
      and unregister the device. 
      An interrupt handler is also needed; it need do nothing more than
      disable further interrupts before the user process is notified
      of the interrupt via a signal (SIGIO). (Clearly, in CapROS it
      is also necessary to prevent continuous interrupts,
      because user processes run with interrupts enabled,
      but on some architectures it may be possible to accomplish this
      with an interrupt controller that has no device-specific knowledge.) 
    <p>
      Apparently kernel code is also needed to support open, release,

      This interface doesn't seem to change the Linux driver model
      in any substantial way. 
      Because there are few (or none) device drivers using this interface
      at this point, it is largely irrelevant from the standpoint of porting
      drivers to CapROS. 
    </li>
    <li>
      A motivation for this feature was to support device drivers
      with licenses more restrictive than GPL. This hardly helps us
      obtain drivers for CapROS.

    <h1>Paging</h1>
    <p>
      The interface between the kernel and the disk driver(s)
      has yet to be fully designed, but should be straightforward.
      For paging in,
      the driver periodically calls a special key to learn of any OIDs
      (object identifiers)
      that need to be fetched. The driver also receives a handle for
      the Activity that needs to be awakened when the OID is available. 
      This handle could be a special key that the driver invokes
      when it is done. 
      Alternatively, the kernel could enqueue the Activity on a wait queue
      based on a hash of the OID,
      and when done the driver could instruct the kernel
      to wake up that queue.
