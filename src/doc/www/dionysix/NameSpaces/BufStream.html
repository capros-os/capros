  <h3>Description</h3> 
  <p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
The set of functions and strucutres that make up the
Buffered Request Streams library provide a means to perform blocking
I/O using a single-threaded, non-blocking <A HREF="NameSpaces.html">dp
server</A>.  
<p>
Server objects which utilize Buffered Request
Streams do not guarantee that reads and writes will complete
immediately.
Reads and writes on these objects will complete eventually;
notification is normally sent to the client by means of an <B>IoWait</B>
invocation.
 <P>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
Dp Servers that implement blocking I/O need a way to accept and buffer
<B>Tread</B> and <B>Twrite</B> commands.  The server itself must promptly return
to fufill other requests.  In other words, the server cannot wait while trying
to satisfy a <B>Tread</B> on, say, an empty pipe.  Instead, the server needs to buffer
the Tread until it can be satisfied.
 <P>
Furthermore, blocking I/O servers need a way to remove buffered
requests according to their <b>tag</b>.  Therefore, while an object
in the server maintains a continuous "stream" of data, it
must also keep track of which data is associated with which request.
<p>
Finally, the server must work with a fixed buffer area -- that is,
no memory can be dynamically allocated during server operation.
<p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
The primary structure in this library is the <CODE>buf_stream</CODE>,
which implements a doubly-linked list of buffers, each containing
<B>Tread</B> or <B>Twrite</B> requests, depending on the type of
<CODE>buf_stream</CODE>.  Requests can be 
<OL>
<LI> <B>appended</B> to a buf_stream,

<LI> fufilled by a data <B>xfer</B> between a two buf_streams, or

<LI> <B>removed</B> from a buf_stream at any time prior to being fufilled. 
</OL>

Buf_streams guarantee that requests will be fufilled in the order
in which they were sent.  Also guaranteed is an <B>R-</B>response 
(Rread, Rwrite, Rerror) for each Tread or Twrite removed from a buf_stream, 
unless it is removed by a Tflush, in which case no response is sent.
 <P>
Internally, each <CODE>buf_stream</CODE> takes buffers from the doubly-linked circular
global buffer list as needed, and relinquishes them as requests
are completed.  Hence, the number of request buffers is not dependent
on the number of buffered request streams.  Instead, the number of
request
buffers is #defined by <code>REQ_BUFS</code> in <code>srvr-params.h</code>.

<p>

The typical server configuration (Fig. 1) has two buf_streams, 
one containing <B>Twrite</B>
requests and the other containing <B>Tread</B> requests. 
 <P>

 <P>


Whenever a Tread or Twrite request is sent to the server, it should
be added to the buf_stream using <B>AppendReadRequest</B> or
<B>AppendWriteRequest</B>.  

After any <B>Append-</B> function call, the server should attempt a 
to satisfy some of the requests pending in its buf_streams
by performing an <B>Xfer</B> command.  Tabort requests should 
utitlize the <B>RemoveRequest</B> function.

  <h3>Functions</h3>
  <dl>

    <dt> <strong>InitGlobalBufs</strong> ()
    <dd> 
	 <p> Initialize a the global buffer list.  Must be called
	     before any of the buffered request streams functions are used.<p>

    <dt> <strong>InitBufStream</strong> (buf_stream *st)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Initialize a buf_stream.<p>


    <dt> <strong>AppendWriteRequest</strong> (buf_stream *st, Word session, HalfWord tag, 
			 HalfWord cid, HalfWord count, Byte *buffer)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Append a Twrite onto a buf_stream.  Sends Rerror if there is
		no room left in the buffer.
	Note that there is no mechanism for <i>offset</i>.
<p>

    <dt> <strong>AppendReadRequest</strong> (buf_stream *st, Word session, HalfWord tag, 
			 HalfWord cid, HalfWord count)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Append a Tread onto a buf_stream.  Sends Rerror if there is
		no room left in the buffer.	Note that there is no mechanism for <i>offset</i>.<p>



    <dt> <strong>RemoveRequest</strong> (Word session, HalfWord tag, HalfWord how)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Search through all buf_streams for Twrite or Tread requests
	     matching <B>tag</B>.  Removes the requests from their 
	     associated buf_streams and sends Rread, Rwrite, or 
	     no response in accordance with <B>how</B>:
<PRE>

#define BUF_ABORT	0	/* how parameter of RemoveRequest*/
#define BUF_FLUSH	1	/* how parameter of RemoveRequest*/

</PRE>
<p>

	     Note that the buf_stream is not specified in this function.
	     All buf_streams are searched for requests (there should
	     be no more than one) matching <B>session</B> and <B>tag</B>.
 <P>
	     Internally, a hash table is used to locate requests
	     quickly by their tag.
 <P>

    <dt> Halfword <strong>BytesPending</strong> (buf_stream *st)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Return the number of bytes available for Xfer in a 
	     read or write stream.<p>


    <dt> <strong>XferStrStr</strong> (buf_stream *st_write, buf_stream *st_read, HalfWord count)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Transfer <B>count</B> bytes of data from a write stream
	     to a read stream.  Sends Rread upon completing each 
	     Tread in the read buf_stream.  <p>


    <dt> <strong>XferStrBuf</strong> (buf_stream *st_write, Byte *buffer, HalfWord count)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Transfer <B>count</B> bytes of data from a write stream
	     to <B>buffer</B>.  The size of the buffer is not checked
             before copying data into it.<p>


    <dt> <strong>XferBufStr</strong> (buf_stream *st_read, Byte *buffer, HalfWord count)
    <dd> 
	 <p> Transfer <B>count</B> bytes of data from <B>buf</B>
	     to a read stream.  Sends Rread upon completing each 
	     Tread in the read buf_stream.  <p>

  <h3>How to use this library in your server code</h3>

<OL>

<LI> Check <code>#DEFINES</code> in <code>srvr-params.h</code>

<PRE>
/* Size of each request buffer for blocking i/o */

#define REQ_BUFSZ 4096

/* Number of global request buffers */

#define REQ_BUFS 128

</PRE>


<LI> Include srvr_buf.h in the server code
<LI> Declare your streams in the server code.  For example, in a pipe
server we might see:
<PRE>

buf_stream my_test_pipe_stream[2];

</PRE>

Where my_test_pipe_stream[0] would be used as the Tread stream
and my_test_pipe_stream[1] would be used as the Twrite stream.

</OL>
