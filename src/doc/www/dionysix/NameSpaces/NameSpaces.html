  <h1>Object Servers in Dionysix</h1>
  Revision 0.2
</center>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p> One of the more challenging issues in the design of Dionysix has
been deciding what the mechanism should be for handling files, pipes,
devices and the like.  The principle difficulty lies in the need to
support asynchronous signalling, which EROS really isn't designed to
support.
<p> For several months, we adopted the view that since I/O
interruption is rare, the basic design should be synchronous.  This
was a dead end.  Eventually, we settled on the asynchronous interface
described here.  The interface is designed to allow non-blocking I/O
to complete with a single CALL/RETURN in the usual case, but supports
both early abort of I/O's and callbacks for blocking I/O.  The design
grew out of the 9P protocol of Plan 9 (see: <a
href="http://achille.research.att.com/plan9/doc/names.html">The Use of
Name Spaces in Plan 9</a> and the Plan 9 <a
href="http://achille.research.att.com/plan9/vol1.html">Reference
Manual</a>).
<p> 9P lacks overt support for three features of UNIX:
<ol>
  <li> There is no support for any equivalent to a
       <strong>superuser</strong> who has the authority to act as any
       other user.
  <li> There is no support for the <strong>setuid</strong> mechanism,
       which allows a program to operate with authorities different
       from the person running it.
  <li> There is no direct support for a client program that operates
       with the simultaneous authority of two (or more) users (as in
       the setuid/setgid system calls).
</ol>
<p> The essential reason for these omissions is that the 9p server
does not trust the client.
<p> The omission of the superuser is probably a good thing.  The UNIX
superuser carries far more authority than is good for it, and as a
result is often abused.
<p> The omission of the setuid bit and the setuid/setgid mechanism is
more problematic.  The setuid bit is frequently used to ensure that
generally accessable objects are accessed only through programs that
maintain their consistency.  In Plan 9, such enforcement policies can
only be implemented by file servers, while we would like them to be
implementable by users in general.  For example, it is unclear to us
how one would implement a revision control mechanism such as RCS as a
general user.
<p> Similarly, the omission of any mechanism for union authorities is
significant.  In spite of the issues raised by <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu:80/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html"><em>The
Confused Deputy</em></a>, it is sometimes useful to act with multiple
authorities.  A clean mechanism for doing so seems too useful to give
up.
<p> Given these problems, we have adopted a subset of the
<strong>9p</strong> protocol, <strong>dp</strong> (for
<strong>D</strong>ionysix <strong>P</strong>rotocol), which retains
the facilities of UNIX within a protocol similar to
<strong>9p</strong>.  This is the protocol used in the EROS POSIX
environment.  <strong>dp</strong> retains some important features of
<strong>9p</strong>:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>dp</strong> can be implemented with a fixed amount of
       server memory per connection.
  <li> <strong>dp</strong> is asynchronous.  While most I/O
       transactions can be completed in a single EROS
       <strong>call</strong> and <strong>return</strong>, the protocol
       does not require synchronous RPC.
</ul>
Differences between <strong>dp</strong> and <strong>9p</strong>
include:
<ul>
  <li> A single <strong>dp</strong> session can act on behalf of
       multiple authorities.
  <li> The <strong>dp</strong> server (at least in Version 0) trusts
       the client rather more than it does in <strong>9p</strong>.
  <li> <strong>dp</strong> provides a mechanism for early abort of an
       I/O operation, the <strong>Tabort</strong> request.  This is
       necessary in support of POSIX signals and other asynchronous
       signalling mechanisms.
</ul>
These differences enable support of the full POSIX semantics on the
client, provided that the client is suitably authorized to support
<em>setuid</em>.
<p> The version of the protocol described here is preliminary, and we
expect will soon be discarded.  In particular, we are disastisfied
with the need to trust the client, and believe that this is basically
a bad idea.  Still, this version of the protocol is sufficient to get
us started.
<h2>2. The Protocol</h2>
<p> A <strong>dp</strong> client holds a capability to the
<strong>dp</strong> server.  The capability encapsulates a session.
Given this, there is no real need for session level authentication as
in <strong>9p</strong>.  Posession of a key to the server is a
necessary and sufficient condition to speak to that server.  The
design assumes that distinct clients will hold distinct keys to the
server.
<p> Clients and Servers communicate using a byte-stream protocol
rather than the EROS call/return model.  This allows the server to
operate asynchronously.  Request and responses are encoded into a
sequence of bytes, and sent to the server using the call/return
mechanism as a transport.
<p> Each time the client invokes the object server, it sends an EROS
message of the form:
<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>W</strong></td>
      <td>Size of response buffer (must be greater than or
	equal to 4)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>B*</strong></td>
      <td>Server requests, expressed as a stream of bytes.</td> 
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>
The server, in its turn, responds with a message of the form:
<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>W</strong></td>
      <td>Number of request bytes accepted</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>B*</strong></td>
      <td>Server responses, expressed as a byte stream.</td> 
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>
<p> Requests are byte-formatted sequences having the following components:
<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>request</strong></td>
      <td>A 16 bit field indicating the request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>tag</strong></td>
      <td>A 16 bit field whose content is specified by the client, and
	will be contained in the reply message from the server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>arguments</em></td>
      <td>Argument specific to a particular request.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>
<p> Each transmitted data buffer should be thought of as appended to
the stream of messages already sent.  Depending on how much space the
server has available, it may elect to receive less than the full
transmission.  In this event, it is the client's responsibility to
drain the response buffer and try again.
<p> Most arguments have a fixed length, which is indicated next to the
name of the argument in the specification.  Some arguments are shown
with the notation <strong>[*</strong><em>N</em><strong>]</strong>,
indicating a variable-length argument of length less than or equal to
<em>N</em>.  In the byte stream, such arguments are preceded by their
byte count.  If the maximum will fit within a single byte, the length
is encoded in a single byte.  Where the maximum will not fit within a
single byte, it is encoded as a two byte size.
<p> All numbers are encoded in the byte stream in <em>little
endian</em> format, regardless of the encoding of the native hardware.
<p> Most object servers respond to requests promptly.  Some object
types do not guarantee that reads and writes will complete without
blocking.  Read and write requests on such objects will eventually
complete, but no timing guarantees are made by the server.  A
mechanism is provided to allow the server to signal completion of
blocking I/O.
<h2>3  The Transport</h2>
<p> The remainder of this note describes the protocol between the
object server and the client.  It describes how to set up and tear
down a connection, the transmit and receive mechanisms, and the
formats of each individual message.
<h3>3.1 Connection Setup and Teardown</h3> 
<p> The first step in establishing communication between client and
server is for the client to invoke the server with a
<strong>connect</strong> invocation.  The connection is terminated by
the <strong>disconnect</strong> invocation.
<dl>
  <dt> <strong>Connect</strong> (OC = 1)
  <dd> 
       <p> Initializes a connection between client and object server.
       <table>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=1>
	     <strong>Reply</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     W
	   </td>
	   <td> If nonzero, indicates that the server implements
	     asynchronous I/O.  The client should be prepared to
	     perform the IOWait invocation to learn when such I/O is
	     completed, or arrange to do periodic transfers.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=1>
	     <strong>Result</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     RC_OK
	   </td>
	   <td>
	     Connection is established
	   </td>
	 </tr>
       </table>
       <p> 
  <dt> <strong>Disconnect</strong> (OC = 2)
  <dd> 
       <p> Causes the connection to be torn down.  The client's key to
       the server is rescinded.
       <table>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=1>
	     <strong>Result</strong>
	   </td>

	   <td>
	     Connection is established
	   </td>
	 </tr>
       </table>
       <p> 
</dl>
<h3>3.1 The Byte Stream</h3>
<p> Requests and responses between client and server are transmitted
as a sequence of byte-formatted messages.  The request and response
byte streams are transmitted between client and server using the call
and return mechanisms as a transport.
<p> The basic invocation of this protocol is the
<strong>transfer</strong> invocation, which moves bytes back and forth
between client and server.
<dl>
  <dt> <strong>Transfer</strong> (OC = 3)
  <dd> 
       <p> Transmits requests to the server and collects responses.
       The server may not accept all of the transmitted byte string,
       but is guaranteed to accept an integral number (possibly 0) of
       requests.
       <table>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=2>
	     <strong>Request</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     W
	   </td>
	   <td> The space available in the response buffer.  It is
	     preferable for this be as large as possible.  If the
	     receive buffer size provided is less than 4, no requests
	     will be accepted by the server.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td align=right>
	     B*
	   </td>
	   <td> Server requests, formatted as a byte string.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=2>
	     <strong>Response</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     W
	   </td>
	   <td> The number of bytes accepted from the sent string.
	     The server will accept requests only if there is
	     available space in the output buffer to place the
	     results, so a failure to accept requests generally means
	     that the output buffer should be drained and the request
	     should be reattempted.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td align=right>
	     B*

	 </tr>

	     <strong>Result</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     RC_OK
	   </td>
	   <td>
	     Transmission succeeded, reply has emptied the response buffer.
	   </td>
	 </tr>

	     RC_OK+1
	   </td>
	   <td> Transmission succeeded, response buffer contained more
	     responses than would fit in the response buffer provided
	     by the client.  Client should <strong>transmit</strong>
	     again (typically with a null request string) to collect
	     remaining responses after processing the responses
	     received.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td align=right>
	     RC_OK+1
	   </td>
	   <td> Transmission succeeded, response buffer contained more
	     responses than would fit in the response buffer provided
	     by the client.  Client should <strong>transmit</strong>

	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td align=right>
	     KT+2
	   </td>
	   <td> Request format error. Either the caller did not
	     provide for a returned acceptance count, or the
	     transmitted message contained a malformed message
	     sequence.
	   </td>
	 </tr>
       </table>
       <p> 
  <dt> <strong>IoWait</strong> (OC = 4)
  <dd> 
       <p> Blocks until an asynchronous I/O completes and the client
       is not expecting a response.  Used to indicate that the client
       should perform a <strong>transfer</strong> operation to obtain
       the result of the asynchronous I/O.
       <p> The usual mechanism for handling asynchronous I/O is for
       the client to establish a helper domain.  The helper domain
       loops performing an IoWait invocation and then calling the
       client to inform it that a transfer operation should be performed.
       <table>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td rowspan=2>
	     <strong>Result</strong>
	   </td>
	   <td align=right>
	     RC_OK
	   </td>
	   <td> An asynchronous I/O has completed.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr valign=top>
	   <td align=right>
	     KT+1
	   </td>
	   <td>Connection has been torn down.</td>
	 </tr>
       </table>
</dl>
<p> The use of the <strong>IoWait</strong> invocation is optional.
Clients may use periodic wakeup to accomplish the same result without
an additional domain.

<h2>4 The Protocol</h2>
<p> Each <strong>dp</strong> message consists of a sequence of bytes
containing the request number, a client-supplied tag, and the
arguments to the request.  Each message is described in detail below.
One area that requires further specification is the possible error
values that can be returned by reply messages.
<p> Every message has a corresponding reply message.  The reply
message has a message number that is one higher than the request
number, and contains the same tag as was specified by the client in
the request.  The tag, in effect, acts as a sequence number for
outstanding requests.  A message will either receive a corresponding
reply with the identical tag or an Rerror response indicating that the
request failed.
<dl>
  <dt> (0) <strong>Rerror</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>err</em>[2]
  <dd> This response is issued by the server to indicate that an error
       occurred on the request with the corresponding tag.  This
       message replaces the normal response message.  <em>err</em> is
       an integer (values to be defined) indicating the error that
       occurred.  <em>ename</em> is a text representation of the
       corresponding error number
       <p> 
  <dt> (1) <strong>Tattach</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>credentials</em>[8] <em>aname</em>[*255]
  <dd> 
       <p> Requests that the object server bind the root of the hierarchy
       named by <em>aname</em> to the given <em>cid</em>.
       <p> 
  <dt> (2) <strong>Rattach</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>uoid</em>[8]
  <dd> 
       <p> Response to the Tattach message.  The returned <em>cid</em>
       should be the same as the <em>cid</em> named by the client.
       The <em>uoid</em> is an 8-bit field that is unique among all
       objects in this hierarchy.
       <p> 
  <dt> (3) <strong>Tclone</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>oldcid</em>[2]
       <em>newcid</em>[2]
  <dd> 
       <p> Requests that the object server make a duplicate of
       <em>oldcid</em> in <em>newcid</em>.  This message is usually
       issued prior to performing a walk operation.
       <p> 
  <dt> (4) <strong>Rclone</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
  <dd> 
       <p> Response to the Tclone message.  The returned <em>cid</em>
       should be the same as the <em>newcid</em> named by the client.
       <p> 
  <dt> (5) <strong>Twalk</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>name</em>[*255]
  <dd> 
       <p> Performs a directory traversal.  The <em>cid</em> supplied
       by the client must identify a directory.  On completion, it
       identifies the component object named by <em>name</em> (if
       any).
       <p> 
  <dt> (6) <strong>Rwalk</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>uoid</em>[8]
  <dd> 
       <p> Response to the Twalk message.  The returned <em>cid</em>
       should be the same as the <em>cid</em> named by the client.
       The <em>uoid</em> is an 8-bit field that is unique among all
       objects in this hierarchy.
       <p> 
  <dt> (7) <strong>Topen</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>mode</em>[1]
  <dd> 
       <p> Opens the named <em>cid</em> for reading and/or writing,
       according to <em>mode</em>.  Legal values for <em>mode</em>
       are:
       <ul>
	 <table>
	   <tr>
	     <td>0</td>
	     <td>Read access</td>
	   </tr>
	   <tr>
	     <td>1</td>
	     <td>Write access</td>
	   </tr>
	   <tr>
	     <td>2</td>
	     <td>Read and write access</td>
	   </tr>
	   <tr>
	     <td>3</td>
	     <td>Execute access</td>
	   </tr>
	 </table>
       </ul>
       In addition, the following values can be <em>or</em>'d with the
       supplied mode, causing the indicated actions:
       <ul>
	 <table>
	   <tr valign=top>
	     <td>0x10</td>
	     <td>Truncate.  If the file is not append only, and the
	       sender of the message has write permissions (in version
	       0 this is always true), the file is truncated.  If the
	       file is append-only, the open will succeed but the file
	       will not be truncated.</td>
	   </tr>
	   <tr valign=top>
	     <td>0x40</td>
	     <td>Remove on close.  File should be removed when the fid
	       is clunked, which requires write permission on the
	       directory.</td>
	   </tr>

       <p> 
  <dt> (8) <strong>Ropen</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>uoid</em>[8]
  <dd> 
       <p> Response to the Topen message.  The returned <em>cid</em>
       should be the same as the <em>cid</em> named by the client.
       The <em>uoid</em> is an 8-bit field that is unique among all
       objects in this hierarchy.
       <p>

       <em>cid</em>, opening it according to the mode specified by
       <em>mode</em>.  for reading and/or writing, according to
       <em>mode</em>.  Valid modes are as described in the
       <strong>open</strong> message.
       <p> The mode word indicates whether an object or directory is
       to be created and the permissions to be associated with the
       newly created object.  The file mode is composed of the
       <strong>or</strong> of the following values:
       <ul>

  <dd>
       <p> Tells the server that the object named by <em>cid</em>
       should be removed.  This requires write permission on the

       <p> 
  <dt> (21) <strong>Twstat</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
       <em>stat</em>[44]
  <dd>
       <p> Rewrites some of the fields of the object's state
       structure.  The <em>atime</em>, <em>mtime</em>, and directory
       bit of the mode field cannot be revised.
       <p> 
  <dt> (22) <strong>Rwstat</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>cid</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Indicates that the object's state structure has been
       updated.
       <p> 
  <dt> (23) <strong>Tflush</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>oldtag</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Causes the previous request named by <em>oldtag</em> to be
       canceled if it has not already completed.  Indicates that the
       client does not wish to receive a reply for the associated
       operation, and will ignore any replies that may already have
       been generated.  Flush operations are <em>always</em> processed
       promptly.
       <p> 
  <dt> (24) <strong>Rflush</strong> <em>tag</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Indicates that the flush operation has completed.
       <p> 
  <dt> (25) <strong>Tabort</strong> <em>tag</em>[2] <em>oldtag</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Causes the previous read or write request named by
       <em>oldtag</em> to be aborted prematurely if it has not already
       completed.  If the operation is still in progress, it will be
       terminated, and an <strong>Rwrite</strong> or
       <strong>Rread</strong> indicating a short read will be
       generated.  The effect of an abort operation is always achieved
       promptly.
       <p> 
  <dt> (26) <strong>Rabort</strong> <em>tag</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Indicates that the abort operation has completed.

  <dt> (27) <strong>Tcredclone</strong> <em>tag</em>[2]
       <em>oldcid</em>[2] <em>credentials</em>[8] <em>newcid</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> A clone of the object identified by <em>oldcid</em> is
       created, having the associated <em>credentials</em>, and named
       <em>newcid</em>.  The new <em>cid</em> is not open, and does
       not necessarily convey authority sufficient to let the new user
       do anything with it.
       <p> 
  <dt> (28) <strong>Rcredclone</strong> <em>tag</em>[2]
       <em>cid</em>[2]
  <dd>
       <p> Response to the Rcredclone message.  The returned
       <em>cid</em> should be the same as the <em>newcid</em> named by
       the client.
       <p>

<h2>5 Usage Notes and Issues</h2>
<p> One issue that is not overtly addressed by this protocol is the
implementation of multiple groups.  The <strong>dp</strong> open
message checks only one user and group at a time.
<p> The effect of multiple groups can be achieved by issuing a series
of <strong>clone</strong> and <strong>open</strong> messages, passing
different credentials for each <strong>open</strong> message.  The
file may end up multiply open.  The server can then clunk the
<em>cids</em> that it doesn't use.
<p> The current protocol does not support hard links.  Hard links are
a bad idea, inducing a rich variety of puzzling behaviors for file
system consistency checkers, and I don't really want to support them
if I can avoid it.  It may be unavoidable.
<h3>5.1 Pipes</h3>
<p> Another issue that is not obviously addressed is how to deal with
pipes and other objects that are really one objects with multiple
connection points.  The general idea is that the pipe server simply
serves up an infinite number of pipe hierarchies that are all named
<strong>clone</strong>.  Opening a <strong>clone</strong> file has the
effect of implicitly creating a new hierarchy rather than opening the
existing one.  Each hierarchy is a directory supporting two names
(e.g. <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>) corresponding to the
end points of the pipe.

<h2>6 Background</h2>
<p> The design of the Dionysix name space mechanism has proven
challenging.  A number of options were debated along the way:
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> One domain per disk file.
  <li> One domain per <em>open</em> disk file.
  <li> One domain per file system.
</ul>
<p> The "one domain per file" approach was used by KeyNIX (see: <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu:80/~KeyKOS/NanoKernel/NanoKernel.html">The
KeyKOS Nanokernel&#174; Architecture</a>).  While this approach is
probably simplest, each file domain requires at least one page for a
stack.  On my linux system at home, the breakdown of files is as
follows:
<center>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Count</th>
      <th align=left>Description</th>
      <th align=right>Percentage</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align=right>31,071</td>
      <td>All files</td>
      <td align=right>100.0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align=right>18,789</td>
      <td>Files &lt;= 4096 bytes</td>
      <td align=right>60.5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align=right>13,134</td>
      <td>Files &lt;= 2048 bytes</td>
      <td align=right>42.3%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align=right>5,301</td>
      <td>Files &lt;= 1024 bytes</td>
      <td align=right>17.0%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
Given this, the one domain per file design seems prohibitive.
<p> The "one domain per <em>open</em> file" approach is more
promising. The principle problem with this approach lies in the need
for reference counting.  If a UNIX server manages to die without
closing its currently open files, the open file objects could last
forever.  In the end, these dangling open files represent a serious
challenge for robustness.
<p> The final design is the one we have adopted.  File systems should
not go away when the referencing UNIX server dies, so the dangling
reference problem does not arise.  In addition, systems like Plan 9
and NFS have adopted this approach successfully, so there is some
reason to be optimistic that it will work correctly.
