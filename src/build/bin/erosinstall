# install can be invoked as:
#
#	install [options] -d dir_name ...
#	install [options] [ -s ] file inst_file
#	install [options] [ -s ] file... inst_dir

# where the 'options' are:
#
#	[-c] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner]

# we do not support the gnuish style options.

# Note that BSD install destroys the source file (idiots) unless
# you pass '-c', so in non-directory cases we pass '-c'.
