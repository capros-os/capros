# This script is command-line compatible with the LINUX install utility,
# but avoids unnecessary copies by checking for actual changes before
# copying the file. In all cases, the mode, owner, and group are updated.
#
# A useful trick that this program takes advantage of is that
# running chmod/chown do NOT change a file's modification time.
#
# install can be invoked in four ways:
#
#	install [options] -d dir_name ...
#		For each dir_name argument:
#		if it is an existing directory, just set the mode, owner, and group.
#		Otherwise, create any missing directories in the dir_name path.
#	install [options] [ -s ] src_file target_file
#		Replace or create target_file with a copy of src_file.
#	install [options] [ -s ] src_file target_dir
#		Copy src_file to a new file of the same name in target_dir.
#	install [options] [ -s ] file... target_dir
#		For each file, copy it to a file of the same name in target_dir,
#		or replace an existing file of that name.
#
# where the 'options' are:
#
#	-m mode		specifies the mode for target files
#				Default is 0755 if -d specified, othewise 0644
#	-o owner	specifies the owner for target files
#	-g group	specifies the group for target files
#				Default for owner and group is the current user.
#	-c			ignored except for BSD
#
# Option -s strips any symbol table.
#
# we do not support the gnuish style options.
#
# Note that BSD install destroys the source file (idiots) unless
# you pass '-c', so in non-directory cases we pass '-c'.
