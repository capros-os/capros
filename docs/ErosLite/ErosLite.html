      EROS is a pure capability system providing high security,
      strong fault containment, and transparent persistence. Recently,
      there has been interest in using this system in an embedded,
      real-time application where transparent persistence is not
      required. The reduced kernel, EROS/Lite, provides a high performance
      IPC substrate, strong isolation and containment, and a real-time
      scheduling mechanism, and will be available for research use on
      i486/Pentium systems and at least one RISC architecture.
      <p> EROS/Lite is a subset of the full EROS system. The necessary
      redesign has led us to a conceptually cleaner and simpler kernel
      architecture which is described in this paper.

<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P> Embedded systems require a higher degree of reliability than
conventional application software.  Protected service domains, in
addition to providing security, provide service containment and fault
isolation.  When a system is built out of small, interconnected
protection domains, reliability and recovery techniques such as
modular redundancy become much easier to apply.  Perhaps more
important, component isolation improves the overall effectiveness of
unit testing by ensuring that errors in one protection domain can be
propagated to another <em>only</em> by means of the specified
interface.  Because of this, only the interface code needs to address
the possibility of bad input.
<p> In spite of the advantages of decomposition, few embedded systems
are designed using these techniques.  Most approaches to decomposition
have adopted a client/server approach.  While easy to understand, the
client/server approach destroys the clean separation between
applications that is necessary for real-time and quality of service
(QoS) based scheduling.  Multiplexing clients with different QoS
requirements onto a single service provider lends itself to difficult
design problems, including priority inversion, starvation, and
resource mismanagment.  In secure environments, all of these issues
result in covert channels and are potential openings for denial of
service attacks.
<p> Noninvasive update mechanisms (i.e. external reprogramming) for
pacemakers is now commonplace. Several current generation mass transit
systems provide mechanisms for remote update.  As such mechanisms
become more powerful, they simultaneously become increasingly
susceptible to computer-based attack.  In the face of such mechanisms,
the line between computer and human viruses becomes very blurry
indeed.
<p> EROS, and it's predecessor KeyKOS, adopts a
client/<em>service</em> approach to protected application composition.
In this approach, each application receives it's own instance of the
services that it uses, and runs under the authority of a
client-specified schedule.  This model allows service QoS to be
structured in several ways:
<ul>
  <li> As conventional multiplexed services, which run under a
       resource allocation dedicated to that service independent of
       the caller.
       <p> 
  <li> As application services, which run under the resources of the
        client application.
       <p> 
  <li> In any mixture of the above; in particular allowing non-QoS
       services to run under general-purpose scheduling policies
       without interfering with QoS-sensitive applications.
</ul>
<p> Historically, EROS and KeyKOS have provided orthogonal
persistence.  While extremely useful for general-purpose computing,
orthogonal persistence is not consistent with the requirements of
real-time or QoS scheduling.  To address this, we have reorganized the
system to allow persistence to be application controlled and/or
entirely removed from the system feature space.  The resulting system,
<strong>EROS/Lite</strong>, provides containment, fault isolation, and
real-time scheduling facilities.  In this paper, we describe the
design of EROS/Lite, including the separation of function between the
storage architecture and the real-time service core.
