	      (4/18/2001, 5:00 pm EST) If you are looking for
	      installation and build instructions, they can now be
	      found <a href="build.html">here</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is the first GPL'd release of the EROS system.
	    To the best of my knowledge, all of the content on this CD
	    may be redistributed under GPL or similarly
	    non-restrictive (e.g. BSD) terms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This release is not a runnable system -- it is more at the
	    "Hello, world" stage.  In particular, the
	    <tt>eros/src/base/sysimage/</tt> directory does not build
	    a useful image at this time. My hope is that with
	    contributions from the community this will soon improve.
