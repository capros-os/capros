      <H1>EROS 0.8.3 (Pre)Released!!!</H1>
    </center>
    <p>
      EROS version 0.8.3 has been released.  Please see the <a
      href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for details.

      <H1>EROS 0.6 Completed!!!</H1>
    </center>
    <p>
      <b>Code is now complete</b> for the 0.6 release of EROS.  I
      (Jonathan) am currently working on the license, which will be
      derived from MPL.  Unfortunately, I became aware of an
      indemnification glitch as I was getting ready to publish the
      license, and that needs to be straightened out first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, I have accepted a position with IBM's T.J. Watson
      Research Laboratory starting in mid November.  This means that I
      am moving during the next month, which will delay the EROS
      release -- I really don't want to release it just before I go
      off the air for a month.  The first EROS release will occur as
      soon as the computers are back up and running and my
      dissertation is submitted.  You can reasonably expect it in mid
      to late January of 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere over the Christmass season I'll be working with people
      on the eros-port and eros-arch lists (see <a
      href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>). to verify that
      they can check out and successfully build the EROS distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      EROS is a research project.  While it is more stable than most,
      there are definitely bugs in the system.  While IBM has been
      kind enough to agree to a grace period, I will have to stop work
      on EROS code fairly soon.  I can continue working on
      documentation.  <b>I'll therefore be looking for a group of
      people to hand off EROS coordination to.</b> If you are
      interested, please join the eros-port list.

    <p>
      The EROS research implementation is now complete, modulo a few
      nits and one bug I want to clean up before release.  It is now
      running long-haul stress tests successfully.

	    I am currently debugging the TCP/IP stack.  After that, I

	    A lot has happened since last we left our saga.  Those of you who have
	    seen the Star Wars re-release will understand.  Here are some of the
	    hiights:
	  <p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> A CPU reserve scheduler has been implemented and tested. Once we
	      put in working sets (after SIGCOMM), EROS will be a fully
	      real-time system.
	      <p>
	    <li>
	      Checkpoint and migration were working, until we stuck in in the
	      CPU reserves.  At the moment the kernel is not saving reserve
	      info. Once that is added (next week), checkpoint will work again
	      -- a simple fix, delayed by our SIGCOMM submission.
	      <p>
	    <li>
	      We have run our first interesting application.  A prototype Active
	      Network router has been built on top of EROS, and it worked
	      essentially on the first try.  Kudos to Steve Muir for a yoeman's
	      job on this!  Look for further information in our next irregular
	      update.
	      <p>
	    <li>
	      We have designed, and will implement shortly, a revised kernel IPC
	      interface.  The new interface transfers (exactly) 4 capabilities, a
	      variable-length data buffer, and (exactly) 4 register values.
	      There are a sufficient number of applications that will benefit
	      from this change to justify it, notably dionysix, but also many
	      EROS programs.
	      <p>
	    <li>
	      We have taken the first steps toward formally proving a model of
	      the EROS kernel semantics.  Much to my surprise, the EROS
	      architecture appears to be proof-friendly.
	      <p>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    The dionysix group is making good progress.  They've decided on
	    a binary-compatible LINUX emulator, and will be starting their
	    implementation shortly.  Things are looking very good among the
	    dyonisians.  (Dynosaurs?)
	  <p>
	    Various folks here at Penn are becoming interested in EROS as a
	    platform for courses and research.  Having something they can see and
	    touch is a big help.

	  <h3>HELP OUR RELEASE</h3>
	  <p>
	    We had originally hoped to release a system in March, and I had
	    tentatively stated this date to several people.  Given the SOSP
	    deadline of March 7, and the very real need to recover afterwards, I
	    expect that our actual date will occur in April or May.  The main
	    sources of delay will be integrating SCSI support into the kernel and
	    testing the installation process.  This system will have limited
	    support for network drivers and SCSI cards.  It seems likely that the
	    following will be supported:
	  <p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> EtherLink III 3c509 ISA cards
	    <li> EtherLink 3c59x XL 10/100 PCI cards
	    <li> SMC-based 10/100 cards (uncertain, highly unlikely)
	    <li> Adaptec 2940/2940W (PCI) adaptor
	    <li> NCR 5c3810 SCSI (PCI) adaptor
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Our test machines have been purchased from XI, Inc., and use the TYAN
	    Titan-II/III and Tomcat-II/II+ motherboards.  I don't want to err by
	    endorsement, but the ability to use the parity bits as ECC is a useful
	    feature in the Triton-II chip set.  The system will *run* on
	    multiprocessors, but will not use more than one processor.
	  <p>
	    We've also run EROS on a hodgepodge of 486 machines.  Pentium machines
	    are more better :-).
	  <p>
	    If you have a Pentium (Pro)/PCI machine, and would be willing to help
	    test the EROS system, we would greatly appreciate your help.  You will
	    need a 100 Mbyte available partition on *any* disk drive. It does not
	    need to be on the boot drive.  We have not tested HD boot from
	    non-boot drives, but booting from floppy will certainly be possible.
	  <p>
	    If you want to help test this first release, please send your machine
	    configuration information to <a href="mailto:eros-port-request@eros-os.org">eros-port-request@eros-os.org</a>.  Be sure to
	    include:
	  <p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Your computer make/model
	    <li> CPU type and speed (e.g. Pentum 133 Mhz)
	    <li> Motherboard type if known
	    <li> Hard disk controller, if known (e.g. Adaptec SCSI 2940)
	      -- we need manufacturer, type (SCSI/IDE) and model.
	    <li> Amount of memory and type if known (EDO, DRAM, SRAM)
	    <li> Disk(s) size
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    We will provide a sequence of floppy image(s) that will do an
	    installation on an available partition.  The early floppies will
	    simply attempt to identify your hardware and ask you to confirm that
	    they got it right (i.e. they will not change anything on your disk).
	    Later floppy images will install themselves on your disk.
	  <p>
	    
	    When we are confident that the system works well, we will provide a
	    cross-environment which will enable you to build your own programs
	    from a linux-based cross environment.  Eventually, we look forward to
	    rehosting the cross environment to EROS.

	  <p> EROS has hit a major milestone.  Until yesterday, all of our

	  <p> The test consists of:
	  <ul>
	      <p> DomCreTest calls DCC to obtain a new domain creator
	      <ul>
		  <p> DCC buys space from the space bank
		  <p> DCC fabricates a new domain creator from this space
		  <p> DCC returns an "entry capability" to the new domain
		    creator to the test shell
	      </ul>
	      <p> DomCreTest calls the new domain creator to obtain an
		unpopulated domain
	      <ul>
		  <p> The domain creator buys space from the space bank
		  <p> The domain creator fabricates a new domain from this
		    space
		  <p> The domain creator returns a "domain capability" to
		    the new domain to the test shell
	      </ul>

	      <p> DomCreTest installs the "hello world" program segment, which
		was built under linux.

	      <p> DomCreTest initializes the startup registers of the hello
		making it callable

	      <p> DomCreTest calls the hello domain
	      <ul>
		  <p> The hello domain prints "hello from hello" and returns
	      </ul>

	      <p> DomCreTest exits
	  </ul>
	  <p> This test is significant for two reasons:
	  <ol>
	    <li> In order for this test to succeed, a great part of the
	      kernel code must be working correctly:
	      <ul>
		<li> Simple and short-circuit segments
		<li> The domain control interface
		<li> The IPC mechanism
		<li> The pagein mechanism (object fault-in)
		<li> All of the state caching architecture.
	      </ul>
	      <p> 
	    <li> We have built a program using the essential mechanisms
	      of the EROS security model.  While the rest is not
	      simple, it is straightforward.

	  <p> As of today, we are now running a system with a checkpoint
	    area.  Our latest generation of cross tools writes objects into
	    the checkpoint area, which is then loaded and used by the
	    running system.  The checkpoint and migration logic is the last
	    large piece of work to be done in the kernel; it's mostly
	    downhill from here.  This step means that we can restart
	    correctly from the last successful checkpoint.
	  <p> Now that the checkpoint recovery is working, ageing and
	    migration (i.e. writing the <em>next</em> checkpoint) should be
	    fairly straitghtforward.
	  <p> Since the last update, we've also put out two papers, one at
	    POS-96 discussing the kernel architecture and the other at
	    IWOOOS-96 showing some of our early IPC performance figures.
	    Copies of both are available through the <a
	      href="../devel/00Devel.html">technical documentation</a> page.
	  <p> Several new project team members have joined us, and we seem
	    to have reached critical mass at last.  A Linux/EROS effort is
	    now actively underway, along with a native TCP/IP and a native
	    X11 system.

	    instruction (which is a supervisor instruction) and takes a
	    general protection fault.
	  <p> We have run the first user-mode instruction!

	  <p> We have partially initiated a user thread.  We've managed to
	    have the first user thread successfully read the pieces of its
	    domain off of the disk.  The object I/O logic was previously
	    working; the new thing is that we are able to start user threads
	    now, and they yield correctly (releasing all locks and their
	    stack in the process).
	  <p> At the moment, the first user thread successfully prepares
	    its domain to run, and then goes to sleep (as a temporary
	    debugging aid).  When it wakes up, it reprepares the domain,
	    finds that an expected lock is missing, and craters.
	  <p> There is a design issue in the locking discipline whose
	    solution isn't immediately obvious at the moment.  What IS
	    obvious is that I'm not up to trying to address it until
	    tomorrow...
	  <p> But cratering in this particular way is sure a nice holiday
	    present.

	  <p> The tools to build the EROS boot image are complete, and
	    have been used to generate a boot floppy containing a single
	    runnable domain with a single instruction -- <code>halt</code>.
	    The volume debugging utility says that the resulting volume
	    contains all of the right things, so the next step is to try to
	    run this domain.
	  <p> If we can get as far as executing the <code>halt</code>
	    instruction, we will know that object faulting and address space
	    construction is working, which tests perhaps 85% of the kernel.
	    Small really is beautiful.

	  <p> The kernel thread scheduler and context switcher are
	    working.  The kernel runs several threads at different
	    priorities, some of which exercise the system in challenging
	    ways.  
	  <p> We have successfully mounted a ramdisk copied from a floppy,
	    which indicates that the core of the disk I/O subsystem is
	    working.
	  <p> Basically, we're ahead of DOS - neither system runs useful
	    applications, but the EROS kernel can walk and chew gum at the
	    same time.
