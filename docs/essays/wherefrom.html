	  <P>
	    A number of people, after reading <a
	    href="capintro.html"><em>What</em> is <em>a Capability,
	    Anyway?</em></a>, have asked ``<em>But where do
	    capabilities come from?</em>''
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    That question can mean a lot of different things:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		How are <em>primitive</em> objects created in a
		capability system?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Where does the system <em>as a whole</em> get its
		capabilities from, and how does it get new ones?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		How are higher level objects, including user objects,
		created in a capability system?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Where does a particular program in a capability system
		get its capabilities from, and how does it get new
		ones?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		How are capabilities stored?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    Each of these questions has a simple answer, and each
	    raises further questions that can be challenging.  In this
	    note I'll try to answer as many of them as I can.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because the answers are much clearer with a concrete
	    example, I rely heavily in this note on examples from EROS
	    illustrate these points. The ideas behind these examples
	    can be used in other systems.  For further information on
	    EROS, you can have a look at the <a
	    href="../eros.html">EROS Home Page</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Are Primitive Objects Created?</h2>
	  <p>
	    First, let me say what I mean when I talk about a
	    ``primitive object.''
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In real systems, there is some place where the rubber
	    meets the road.  Processes, files, directories, and so
	    forth are abstractions provided by the system, but they
	    are also ``objects'' that the system lets you manipulate.
	    Ultimately, these objects are constructed out of other
	    objects -- mainly disk storage.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Disk sectors, in contrast, are primitive objects.  A disk
	    drive manufacturer can tell you what they are made of, but
	    as far as the operating system is concerned a disk sector
	    is a basic building block.  An indivisible, basic building
	    block of this sort is a primitive object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The choice of primitive objects, and the mechanism(s) used
	    to name them, are among the most basic decisions in any
	    operating system design.  The following subsections
	    illustrate two very different alternatives.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Some thoughts from Lewis Caroll on the subject of on
	    naming, identity, and confusing the two:

		  "The name of the song is called `Haddocks' Eyes.'"
		<p>
		  "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?" Alice
		  said, trying to feel interested.
		<p>
		  "No, you don't understand," the knight said, looking
		  a little vexed. "That's what the name is
		  <em>called</em>.  The name really <em>is</em> `The
		  Aged Aged Man.'"
		<p>
		  "Then I ought to have said `That's what the
		  <em>song</em> is called'?" Alice corrected herself.
		<p>
		  "No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The
		  <em>song</em> is called `Ways And Means': but that's
		  only what it's <em>called</em> you know!"
		<p>
		  "Well, what <em>is</em> the song, then?" said Alice,
		  who was by this time completely bewildered.
		<p>
		  "I was coming to that," the Knight said. "The song
		  realy <em>is</em> `A-sitting On A Gate': and the
		  tune's my own invention."

	  <h3>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive Objects in EROS</h3>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, the primary objects are <a
	    href="../devel/ObRef/primary/Page.html">pages</a>, <a
	    href="../devel/ObRef/primary/Node.html">nodes</a>, and <a
	    href="../devel/ObRef/primary/Number.html">numbers</a>.
	    Pages and Nodes are both low-level disk objects.  Numbers
	    represent integers in the range [0..2<sup>96</sup>-1].
	    These objects are not composed out of more basic objects.
	    There are also some objects (really services) that are
	    implemented by the kernel that might be considered
	    primitive.  These kernel objects have no state.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    These primitive objects need to be named by the system,
	    and the names need to fit within a capability.  It is
	    desirable that capabilities be of some fixed size, so the
	    name can only be a fixed number of bits long (in EROS they 
	    are 64 bits).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This tends to result in a sort of odd view of things: all
	    of the objects that are ever going to exist exist when the
	    system is first installed.  Some of them (like pages on a
	    disk that hasn't been attached yet) are going to take a
	    really long time to respond if you try to access them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Think of disk pages as being like electrons: there is some
	    fixed number (however large) of electrons in the universe.
	    Some of them are near at hand (like a connected disk) and
	    some of them are pretty far away (like a disk we haven't
	    added yet).  We don't create new electrons (yet); we just
	    rearrange the ones that we have in new configurations.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, then, <em>primitive objects are neither created
	    nor destroyed</em>.  Your access to them can be
	    invalidated, but the object itself conceptually exists
	    forever.
	  </p>
	  <h3>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive Objects in Other Systems</h3>
	  <p>
	    EROS is persistent, so it is fairly easy to say what the
	    primitive objects are and to account for what happens to
	    them.  Other systems do not adopt this approach, and their
	    stories about primitive objects are greatly complicated as
	    a result.  While I use Amoeba as an example here, the
	    questions raised should be asked about almost every
	    operating system out there today.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The <a
	    href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/amoeba.html">Amoeba</a>,
	    distributed system, for example, is not persistent.  When
	    a program wants to create a new process, it performs an
	    <i>exec_process()</i> call, which fabricates a new process
	    from an executable file and returns a capability to the
	    new process.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In Amoeba, the process is manufactured out of whole cloth.
	    This raises a number of questions:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		From what storage was the process created, and by what 
		authority was this storage allocated?
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Answers:
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The process was created from swap space, which is a
		finite resource that is not properly accounted for in
		most systems.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		No special authority was required to create the
		process, which means that I can crash the system by
		allocating too many processes.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Adding space quotas doesn't really help, as it
		increases the number of operations in the system that
		can fail due to lack of space.  A better design would
		require the creating program to present a capability
		for the space that will be used.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The file presumably came from a file system, which
		raises some interesting security issues.  How do we
		account for where the file storage came from and why
		we can trust the supplier?  How do we know that the
		file we intended to run has not been replaced?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    In Amoeba, <em>the capability to the process is made up on
	    demand</em>.  The saving grace is that capabilities are
	    not stored to the disk, so it suffices for the allocator
	    (in this case, the operating system) to remember which
	    object numbers have been used during the current
	    execution.
	  </p>
	  <h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Does the <em>System</em> get its
		Capabilities From?</h2>
	  <p>
	    The answer to this question is system-specific, but most
	    systems are pretty similar.  There is some storage
	    manager, which may be the kernel, and this storage manager 
	    has the authority to create capabilities to any primitive
	    object.  It is the responsibility of the storage manager
	    to make sure that it doesn't give the same primitive
	    object out to multiple parties.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The following is a description of how this actually works
	    in EROS.
	  </p>
	  <h3>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a New Drive Under EROS</h3>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, when a new drive is connected to the system, a
	    utility called the <em>disk formatter</em> is used to
	    create EROS partitions and to define EROS <em>ranges</em>
	    within those partitions.  A range is a contiguous sequence
	    of pages on the disk, and has a known starting <em>object
	    identifier</em> (OID).  Pages within the range are
	    numbered sequentially starting from this object
	    identifier.  The disk formatter performs a high-level
	    format on each of these ranges to make it suitable for use
	    by EROS.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The disk formatter imposes some rules about the object
	    identifiers.  Either
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		They do not overlap any existing identifiers at all,
		in which case the new range is considered "new"
		storage.
	      </p>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  or
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		They <em>exactly</em> match some existing range, in
		which case the new range is a <em>duplex</em> of the
		old range.  Duplexing is a low-level function of the
		EROS kernel.
	      </p>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Under the covers, an EROS page capability contains an
	    object identifier, a type (page or node) and a version
	    number.  The object identifiers come from a predefined
	    space.  In EROS, a page OID is a number in the range
	    [0..2<sup>64</sup>).  When you invoke a page capability,
	    the range table is consulted to find the appropriate
	    range, and then a lookup is done within that range to find
	    the actual page.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Once a new range is defined, it is either handed to the
	    master EROS storage manager (the prime space bank) for use
	    as new pages, or a special sub-bank is created and handed
	    back to the caller of the disk formatting utility.  The
	    second case is used for things like database programs that 
	    want to manage their own storage.
	  </p>
	  <h3>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabricating New Pages</h3>
	  <p>
	    The next question to ask is: ``Where do the new page
	    capabilities come from?''
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The answer is that the disk formatter doesn't actually
	    create any new page capabilities.  The EROS storage
	    manager (the prime space bank) holds a special capability
	    known as a <a
	    href="../devel/ObRef/kernel/Range.html">range
	    capability</a>.  A range capability specifies a range of
	    OIDs, and allows the holder to manufacture page and node
	    capabilities with any OID in that range.  If you like, you
	    can think of the <em>range capability</em> as representing
	    a set of all pages and nodes in the corresponding range.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The prime space bank holds a range capability for the
	    entire range of OIDs.  It avoids giving out capabilities
	    to nonexistent pages by remembering which ranges are
	    valid.  It knows the list of valid ranges because it
	    trusts the disk formatting utility.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In summary, then: <em>The system never gets any new
	    capabilities.</em>
	  <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;How are Higher Level Objects Created?</h2>
	  <p>
	    A higher level object is simply one that is built out of
	    primitive objects.  In EROS, these include processes,
	    address spaces, system services, files, directories, and
	    so forth.  Since a higher-level object is built out of
	    primitive objects, there is always some unique primitive
	    object that we can use to identify the higher-level
	    object.  Two examples:
	  </p>
	  <h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Process Creation in EROS</h3>
	  <p>
	    In EROS, a <a
	    href="../devel/ObRef/primary/Process.html">process</a> is
	    made up of some number of nodes (how many is architecture
	    specific), one of which serves as the <em>process
	    root</em>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In some sense, you will note, we haven't actually created
	    any objects when we make a process out of nodes.  What has
	    really happened is that we have agreed to pretend that
	    these nodes constitute a process for the moment.  A
	    natural way to name the process is by taking the object
	    identifier of the process root and creating a capability
	    with a new <em>type</em> that tells the kernel to use the
	    process abstraction instead of the node abstraction.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In
	    EROS, this is exactly how a process capability is built.
	    There is a kernel service called the <a
	      href="../devel/ObRef/kernel/ProcessTool.html">process
	      tool</a>.  Given a node capability, the process tool
	    returns a process capability to that node.  This
	    effectively turns the node into a process root.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two observations about this design:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The EROS kernel is not harmed if both process
		capabilities and node capabilities exist at the same
		time for the same node.  It therefore does not care if
		this is so.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		There are ways that a user program <em>might</em> be
		harmed if a node capability exists to one of your
		processes.  There is a standard system utility, called 
		the <a
		  href="../devel/ObRef/standard/ProcessCreator.html">process
		  creator</a> that provides this guarantee to programs 
		that need it.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    A similar technique is used for <a
	      href="../devel/ObRef/primary/AddressSpace.html">address
	      space</a> objects, though in that case the protection of 
	    a process tool is unnecessary.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Note, however, that in the case of processes, the higher
	    level object was not ``created'' in the usual sense:
	    nothing is built from scratch when an EROS process comes
	    into the world.
	  </p>
	  <h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;User-Defined Objects</h3>
	  <p>
	    In most capability systems (and for that matter in most
	    microkernel systems), programs can define and implement
	    new objects, which are often referred to as
	    <em>user-defined objects</em>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From the operating system's perspective, no new object is
	    defined.  A user-defined object is simply a capability
	    that invokes the <em>program</em> that a process obeys.
	    The operating system provides a special capability type,
	    referred to as a <em>start capability</em> (EROS), or an
	    <em>entry port</em> (most others).  When this capability
	    is invoked, the passed information is supplied to the
	    program (as distinct from the process).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    What the program does with the supplied information is
	    entirely up to the program.  Among other things, this
	    allows programs to define new object types.  To the holder
	    of the start capability, it appears that they hold a
	    capability to a new object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition to a distinct capability type, a start
	    capability typically includes some extra bits that are
	    supplied to the program by the operating system when it is
	    invoked.  This bits can be used to distinguish one object
	    from another, or to distinguish between multiple services
	    or service interface versions implemented by the same
	    program.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    One tricky issue raised by user-defined objects is ``So
	    what <em>is</em> an object?''  EROS takes the view that an
	    object is something that has a well defined interface.
	    While two capabilities can be compared for <em>identity</em>
            (they are the same thing),
	    there is no means to compare them for <em>equality</em>
            (they do the same thing).
	  </p>
	  <h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Does <em>My</em> Program Get
	    Capabilities?</h2>
	  <p>
	    The last question is the one that people generally seem to 
	    be asking when they ask where capabilities come from.  The 
	    answer is simple, but people seem to have a hard time
	    figuring out how it translates into practice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a capability system, a new program (we'll call it
	    <em>new</em>) gets its capabilities in two ways:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		<em>New</em> receives an initial set of capabilities
		when it is created.  These are supplied by
		<em>new</em>'s creator (which is another program).
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If another program receives a capability to
		<em>new</em>, it can invoke <em>new</em> and pass it
		additional capabilities if it desires.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <h3>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Modeling UNIX Authority</h3>
	  <p>
	    This may not seem like a lot of flexibility, so let's look 
	    at how this could be used to implement the authorities
	    that a UNIX program normally holds.  Since UNIX has no
	    ability to transfer capabilities (or at least none that is 
	    widely used), all of this authority comes from the initial 
	    authorities.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A UNIX program has the following authority:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Access to a file system root (/), which is like a
		capability to a directory object.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Access to a ``current working directory'', which is
		also like a capability to a directory object.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The right to send signals to its children (a
		capability set) and in some cases to members of its
		process group and terminal group (also capability
		sets).  Since a UNIX program does not have other
		authorities over such programs, these sets must be
		wrapped by ``signal manager'' objects, and the UNIX
		program is given a capability to the signal manager.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Note that the UNIX emulator can add and remove things
		from these sets to model the creation and destruction
		of new processes.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Access to a source of storage from which page
		allocations are satisfied and new processes are
		created (a space bank).
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Access to the network subsystem.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		A process holds file descriptors to open files, which
		again are like capabilities
		to file objects.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;How are Capabilities Stored?</h2>
	  <p>
	    Finally, we get to the last question, which is how
	    capabilities are to be stored.  Usually, the real question 
	    behind this question is: ``Where do capabilities go when
	    the system is shut down, and how can I arrange to get them 
	    back?''
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a persistent system like EROS, processes do not go away
	    until they exit voluntarily. There is no need to take
	    special measures to get capabilities back: they are never
	    lost in the first place.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In a non-persistent system like Amoeba, some arrangement
	    must be made to store capabilities in a permanent store.
	    In non-persistent systems, this is usually accomplished
	    with encrypted capabilities, which can be stored as normal 
	    data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The main problem in non-persistent systems is making sure
	    that the wrong people cannot then read the files and
	    thereby get their hands on the capabilities.  In the end,
	    non-persistent systems are forced to resort to some sort
	    of access list based mechanism to protect the file system,
	    which is insecure, for reasons described <a
	    href="capintro.html#acl">here</a>.  This is why EROS is
	    persistent.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    UNIX systems get around this problem by not letting you
	    store capabilities at all.  Open file descriptors are
	    simply lost when the system crashes; the corresponding
	    files must be reopened by way of the file system.
