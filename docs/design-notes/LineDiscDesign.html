<h1>Line Discipline Design Note</h1>
<P>
This is a proposed design of the line discipline for EROS, the
Extremely Reliable Operating System.

 <H2>Basic Ideas (introduction?)</H2>
<P>
In this design, we view the Line Discipline as a "filtering" module
which sits between a <em>Character Source</em>, which provides both a
source of characters to process and a sink for writing output to.  In
this view, there are two "sides" to the line discipline interface:

<UL>
  <LI> The interface the client sees, and
  <LI> the interface to the character source (i.e. serial device,
       console, etc) that the line discipline gets the characters it
       processes from.
</UL>

This design note covers the requirements and design of both of these
interfaces.

</P>

<H3>Prevailing Assumptions</H3>
<P>
This design was done with a few assumptions and biases:
<UL>
  <LI> Parts of the Unix termios functionality was used as both a guideline to
       what basic functionality is needed in a line discipline.  The
       Unix termios facility as a whole is also used as an example of
       something which is going to have to be emulated as a client of the
       line discipline.
  <LI>others ...
</UL>
</P>

 <H2>Requirements</H2>

  <H3>Line Discipline Requirements</H3>

<P>
There are a few requirements we saw as important in the design of
the EROS line discipline:

<UL>
  <li> Speed -- the line discipline should not have a large processing overhead
  <li> The Line Discipline should provide basic erase processing,
       including character, "word", and line erase.
  <li> The line discipline should provide a way to select what input
       and output processing is desired, including:
       <UL>
	 <LI>Whether or not to do erase processing 
	 <LI>the presence of "stop" characters (i.e. characters whose
	      reciept causes immediate notification)
	 <LI>Whether or not to echo entered characters
	 <LI>etc.
       </UL>
       These should be independently selectable.
  <LI> The ability to pass on some control information to the
       character source
</ul>

There were some other requirements that we felt were <em>not</em> the
job of the EROS line discipline:

<UL>
  <li> Multiplexed input and output -- The EROS line discipline only
       supports a single reader/writer/controller.
</UL>

</p>

  <H3>Character Source Requirements</H3>
<p>
Character sources generate and accept characters.  Some examples of
character sources are:
<ul>
  <li> Terminal devices
  <li> The console in text mode
  <li> Telnet/rlogin sessions.
</ul>

The general requirements for the character source interface are:
<ul>
  <li>Early termination of blocked requests -- There has to be a way
       for a blocked request to return before being completely
       fulfilled. (i.e. timeouts, "stop" characters, etc)
  <li>There should be a generic way to control the character source.
  <li>The interface must be implementable in a kernel key.
</ul>

</p>

 <H2>Interface</h2>

  <H3>Character Source Interface</H3>

   <H4>Operations</H4>
<P>
The Character Source Interface consists of four operations:
<TABLE>
  <TR><B>
    <TD class="Heading">Operation</TD>
    <TD class="Heading">Description</TD>
  </B></TR>
  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD class="CMacro">OC_CharSrc_Write</TD>
    <TD class="Description">
      A Write is a <em>non-blocking</em> call which consists of a text
      message containing the characters to write.  The character
      source attempts to write as many characters as it can without
      blocking.  It returns <EM class="CMacro">RC_OK</EM> when done,
      with a count of how many characters were successfully written.
      <P>
      If the character source's write buffer fills (i.e. it wrote less
      than you asked it to write), a
      <EM class="CMacro">CharSrc_WriteSpaceAvailEvent</EM> event will be
      posted when it has partially emptied.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD class="CMacro">OC_CharSrc_WaitForEvent</TD>
    <TD class="Description">
      A WaitForEvent call consists of a message with a maximum read
      count and an event mask.  If any of the events in the event mask
      have already fired, the call returns immediately.  Otherwise,
      the call blocks, waiting for an event in the event mask to
      fire.  There can be a maximum of one reader blocked on each
      Character Source.
      <P>
      On success, returns <EM class="CMacro">RC_OK</EM>, the events which
      have fired, and any characters recieved, up to the number requested.
      </P><P>
      Returns <EM class="CMacro">RC_CharSrc_OneWaiterOnly</EM> if
      there is already someone waiting on this Character Source.

  </TR>
  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD class="CMacro">OC_CharSrc_PostEvent</TD>
    <TD class="Description">
      A PostEvent call consists of an event mask, which must only
      consist of user-defined events.  The effect is to fire the
      events specified.  The main use of this call is to notify a
      thread blocked on WaitForEvent that something requires its
      attention.
      <P>
      Returns <EM class="CMacro">RC_OK</EM> on success,
      <EM class="CMacro">RC_RequestError</EM> if the event mask
      contains non-user events.

    <TD class="Description">
      A Control call consists of a ControlMessageType plus additional

      rest can be used for device-specific status and control

  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD class="CMacro">
      <A NAME="TimeOutControl">CharSrc_Control_SetTimeout</A>
    </TD>
    <TD class="Description">
      Uses the two register arguments.  The first argument,
      <EM>InitialChars</EM> is the number of initial characters to be
      recieved before the timeout begins.  (usually 1) The second
      argument, <EM>Timeout</EM>, is the length of the timeout, in
      milliseconds.  A <EM>Timeout</EM> of zero means an immediate
      return after <EM>InitialChars</EM> characters have been read.
      (This could be useful if you wanted to have characters returned
      as they were typed, but also take advantage of any buffering
      that occurred). A <EM>Timeout</EM> of
      <EM class="CMacro">WORD_MAX</EM> disables the timeout mechanism.

      </P><P>

      The TimeOutEvent will be fired at least <EM>Timeout</EM>
      milliseconds after <EM>InitialChars</EM> have been received.
      The timeout is turned off after a successful WaitForEvents call
      has completed.
      </P>

    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

  <H3> Line Discipline Interface</H3>
<P>
The Line Discipline follows the Character Source Protocol outlined
above.  It acts as a "filter", taking in and writing out characters to
a "background" character source which is passed in during
initialization.  The Line Discipline module handles such things as
echo processing, erase processing, etc.  The controls for the line
discipline are implemented as additional ControlMessages.
</P>
   <H4>Modes of the Line Discipline</H4>
<P>
The LineDiscipline interface has two main modes:
<TABLE>
  <TR><B>
    <TD class="Heading">Mode</TD>
    <TD class="Heading">Description</TD>
  </B></TR>
  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD>Raw Mode</TD>
    <TD class="Description">Raw mode acts exactly like a standard
      Character Source module, except that basic input and output
      processing (like echoing) can be enabled.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR VALIGN=top>
    <TD>Line Mode</TD>
    <TD class="Description">When in Line Mode, the Line Discipline
      acts a bit differently from a standard Character Source.
      First, no data is returned to the reader until either a Special
      character appears or the Line Discipline's buffer fills.  In
      particular, the timeout parameters only effect the speed of the
      LineDiscipline's response to its input.  In fact, the timeout
      event will *never* be sent to the reader while in Line Mode.
      Also, UserEvents will not cause any data to be returned.
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

   <H4>Line Discipline Control Messages</H4>
