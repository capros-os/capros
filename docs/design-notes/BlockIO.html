  <h1>The EROS Block I/O Subsystem</h1>
</center>
<p> This note describes the design of the EROS block I/O subsystem.
Block (and eventually network) I/O in EROS differ from I/O on other
devices in that the I/O may be initiated by either the kernel or by a
key invocation.  Block I/O is particularly challenging because the
single-level store must have a fairly tight relationship with the disk
subsystem. Things are further complicated by the fact that some
devices on a block controller may be user accessable, while others are
accessable only to the kernel.
<h2>Ranges, Partitions, and Controllers</h2>
<p> EROS treats disk partitions as volumes. These volumes can be
either EROS volumes or non-EROS volumes.  EROS volumes can be accessed
only by the kernel or the holder of a suitable disk device
key. Because disk devices can be rearranged while the system is shut
down, disk device and disk partition keys are invalidated by a system
restart.
<p> EROS partitions are in turn subdivided into ranges.  Each range is
either a <strong>node</strong>, <strong>page</strong>, or
<strong>checkpoint log</strong> range, and names the partition in
which it lives.  The partition, in turn, names an associated
controller and unit.
<p> Putting all of this together, we get:
<pre>
 Range Table           Partition table
+-----------+          +-----------------------+
|     ------+-----+    |                       |
+-----------+     |    ~                       ~
|           |     |    |                       |
~           ~     |    +-----------------------+
|           |     +--->| ... | unit | ctrlr ---+---> BlockCtrlr
+-----------+          +-----------------------+
</pre>
<p> By walking the partition table, the controller can identify all of
the partitions associated with a particular unit.  Similarly, by
walking the range table, it can identify all of the ranges associated
with a given partition.
<h3>Sector Addressing</h3>
<p> These days, there are far too many ways of addressing sectors on a
disk drive.  In IDE subsystems alone, there are <em>four</em> distinct
addressing modes that need to be considered:
<ul>
  <li> The BIOS translated geometry (C/H/S).
  <li> The Disk's logical geometry (C/H/S) -- the geometry it presents
       to the outside world.  This is the geometry that is visible at
       the controller's register-level interface on older drives.
       Newer drives frequently allow geometry to be selected on a
       request by request basis.
  <li> The Disk's physical geometry (C/H/S), which is used internal to
       the drive, but which we can discover on inquiry.
  <li> Linear block addressing (lba), in which the disk is presented
       as a sequence of linearly addressed blocks.
</ul>
<p> Regrettably, there are many utilities (notably disk partitioning
software) that have traditionally exposed to the user the C/H/S style
of disk geometry -- usually the BIOS version.  What's truly stupid is
that these utilities continue to require that partitions begin at
cylinder boundaries, even though the "cylinder" in question is a
fiction being maintained by the BIOS.  For this reason, EROS will
expose <em>all</em> of these geometries through the disk device key if
appropriate.
<p> Using the BIOS geometry leads to a variety of problems, mostly
having to do with limitations on the overall size of the drive.
Because of this, EROS uses the <strong>linear block address</strong>
form (lba) for <em>all</em> device types, even if the disk hardware
does not directly support such an addressing mode.  If the hardware
requires it, EROS relies on the driver to translate the lba value into
cylinder, head, and sector terms.  Further, if the hardware requires
that I/O requests be broken up due to cylinder boundary crossings, it
is the responsibility of the disk driver to do so.
<h3>The Partition Structure</h3>
<p> Given all of this mess, the partition structure is as follows:
<pre>
struct Partition {
    CHS      bios_start;  // geometry as seen by BIOS
    CHS      bios_end;    // ditto
    Word     lba_start;   // offset in disk as LBA.
    Word     sz;          // size in sectors
    Byte     type;        // machine specific
    Byte     active;      // DOS vestige
    Byte     unit;        // unit on block device
    Byte     ndx;         // index of partition on device
    BlockDev *ctrlr;      // Controller class
    Word     uniqueID;    // used for partition keys

    void AddRequest(IoRequest*);
};
<p> Some notes on this particular structure, mostly so I don't forget
why I did things this way:
<ul>
  <li> Some controllers will elect to implement a single operation
       request queue, so a request queue pointer was undesirable.
       Actually, I can't think of anything that really ought to do
       this, but I'ld like that option as a way to enforce
       serialization across busted IDE interfaces.
       <p> 
  <li> The unique ID field is not repeated within any given boot
       cycle, and allows us to hand out partition keys and rescind
       them when the partition is deleted.
       <p> 
  <li> The index field is relative to the unit, and allows us to
       return partitions to the caller in a consistent order
       regardless of where they happened to land in the master
       partition table.
       <p>
  <li> An unallocated entry is indicated by a NULL ctrlr pointer.
</ul>
<p> The I/O operations permitted on a partition are those that can be
expressed in IoRequest structures.
<h3>The Request Structure</h3>
<p> I've gone back to a simpler IoRequest structure with this design.
Every IoRequest structure contains all of the information necessary to
fully perform the requested I/O.  The current design has too many
wandering pointers for my liking, and lends itself to bad programming.
Perhaps more important, the current design exhibits hierarchical
allocation, which makes non-persistent I/O more complicated.
<p> In the revised design, the content of the UnitIoRequest and
IoRequest structures will be essentially merged, and the IoRequest
structure will be replaced with a <strong>DuplexedIO</strong>
structure.  The <strong>DuplexedIO</strong> structure captures the
coordination across independent <strong>Request</strong>
structures.
<p> This change has two desirable consequences:
<ul>
  <li> The <strong>Request</strong> structure can be used across all
       block devices, and can be more readily modified for things like
       scatter/gather DMA when the time comes.
       <p> 
  <li> The resulting structure is much closer to the structures
       already used by NetBSD, FreeBSD, and LINUX, making it easier to
       borrow insight from the drivers used by those systems.
</ul>
