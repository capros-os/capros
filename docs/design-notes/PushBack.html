	    <h1>The PushBack Mechanism</h1>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    This note describes a mechanism for forcing a client to
	    re-issue an invocation to a server. The mechanism allows a
            server to examine a client request, decided that it should
            not be processed eagerly, and place the client on a
            blocked in-kernel queue that can be released when the
            server chooses to release it. A particularly useful
            property of this design is that it allows the service to
            use the scheduling and queueing mechanisms of the kernel
            directly rather than introducing a service-level
            scheduling policy that is both opaque to and ignorant of
            requestor priorities.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
	  <p>
	    In the current EROS system, multiplexed services
	    (i.e. services that handle multiple clients) are
	    frequently required to interleave client-requested
	    operations. Client A may make a request that cannot yet be
	    satisfied. Client B's request <em>can</em> be serviced
	    immediately, and therefore should not be delayed by A.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the current system, this is accomplished by storing the
	    resume key to client A, returning to Void, and later
	    performing a SEND when it is time to respond to A. This
	    approach has several difficulties:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It requires the service to allocate storage for the
		resume keys. This can present a denial of resource
		issue.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		It means that the service is effectively running a
		second level scheduler, and that this scheduler is
		potentially not behaving in a fashion consistent with
		the kernel scheduler. This is a particular issue for
		multithreaded/multipriority services.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    This design note describes a mechanism that resolves both
	    issues by allowing a service to cause a requestor to
	    ``call back later.'' The essential insight is that causing
	    a client to resend exactly the data that it sent before
	    does not disclose new information to the service, and is
	    therefore safe.
	  </p>
	  <h1>2. Background</h1>
	  <p>
	    A resume key is usually thought of as a continuation that
	    names the instruction <em>following</em> the trap
	    instruction of the corresponding CALL. In this view, the
	    trap instruction is thought of as a single ``unit of
	    operation,'' and during the call, the calling is halted at
	    the interstice between that trap instruction and the
	    following instruction.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This understanding isn't quite right. The actual CALL
	    implementation is broken into <em>three</em> units of
	    operation:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		In phase one, a rendevous attempt is made with the
		invokee process, and the invocation arguments are
		transferred. This phase can fault recoverably at
		various stages, and if so, it is rolled back and
		restarted after the fault is resolved. [Note this
		implies that the invokee may observe phantom data from
		incompleted invocations if it is multithreaded.] After
		the invoking argument transfer succeeds, phase two
		begins.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		In phase two, the PC of the invoker is advanced and
		the invoker moves to the <em>waiting</em> state.
		During this phase, the invokee moves to the
		<em>running</em> state.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		At some later time (when the invocation of the resume
		key occurs), the reply arguments are accepted, the
		CALLing process enters the <em>running</em> state, and
		it resumes execution.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    Charlie Landau and I have together proposed that phase one
	    could be subdivided to support long strings. The
	    ``pushback'' observation is that phase 2 can safely be
	    rolled back as well at the request of the server. That is,
	    at any time <em>after</em> phase two, the invokee can
	    safely back the invoker PC up to point at the trap
	    instruction, causing the invocation to be restarted.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The security implications of this are as follows:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		A service is now entitled to cause a client to perform
		additional work at client expense (the retry). This
		has real-time implications, which is a requirements
		specification issue, but it is not a security issue.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If the invocation arrived via a wrapper object, the
		server is in a position to re-point the wrapper object
		(by changing its keeper). This is functionally no
		different than forwarding the request directly. 
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		``Through'' services -- services that forward requests
		while dropping out of the call chain by performing a
		RETURN to a downstream service forwarding a resume key
		to the original caller, must be prepared for the
		possibility that a request will be replayed. To our
		knowledge, the need for such ``through'' services is
		subsumed by the new mechanism.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1>3. The Mechanism</h1>
	  <p>
	    The pushback mechanism has two parts: a mechanism to force
	    the request to be retried and a mechanism to queue the
	    requestor. As we do not (for now) want this mechanism to
	    become ubiquitous, the current proposal is to introduce a
	    new, miscellaneous key type, <b>misc(PushBack)</b> that is
	    used to push back a request. One of the arguments to the
	    pushback operation is clearly the resume key. The
	    essential design question is: what should the other be?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The second key to the PushBack operation should be some
	    form of node key. There would appear to be two ``natural''
	    choices for this key:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Introduce a new state bit in the wrapper node format
		key, <b>WrapperStallQ</b>, and use a wrapper key as
		the second argument.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Introduce a new node key type, <b>StallQueue</b>, and
		a new in-kernel ``preparation type'' for nodes.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Functionally, the two are interchangeable. When a process
	    invokes a <b>StallQueue</b> object, or equivalently, a
	    wrapper node whose <b>WrapperStallQ</b> bit is set, the
	    effect is similar to the what happens when the process
	    invokes a start key to a non-available domain: the process
	    is left in the running state, and is placed on the stall
	    queue associated with the wrapper/stall! node. Given this,
	    I'm going to proceed with the wrapper-based approach.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The kernel stall queue associated with the wrapper node is
	    explicitly awakened when the stall queue node is
	    deprepared from a segment node back into an ordinary
	    node. This is done under the following conditions:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The ageing mechanism is gearing up to remove the node
		from memory.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Some slot in the node is modified by means of a node
		key swap operation.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Note that node stall queues are aliased, so actions on
	    nodes unrelated to the particular wrapper node may (with
	    low likelihood) cause the stalled processes to
	    awaken. This means that services using the PushBack
	    mechanism must treat it as a ``no later than''
	    guarantee. It is guaranteed that changing the format key
	    of the wrapper node will awaken all processes currently
	    stalled on that node, and consequently, that all stalled
	    processes will then reissue their respective
	    invocations. However, it is possible that the
	    re-invocations will occur sooner due to actions taken by
	    the kernel independent of the service.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the current kernel design, there is no practical means
	    to eliminate the ``restart on removal'' behavior, but it
	    would probably be feasible to queue the clients
	    specifically on a singleton node rather than on an aliased
	    queue if aliasing proves in practice to be burdensome.
