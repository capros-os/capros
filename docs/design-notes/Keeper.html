  <H1>x86 Keeper Construction</H1>
</center>
<p> <em>NOTE: This design note has been supersceded by the
introduction of small spaces.  The basic address space keepers now run
as small spaces that explicitly construct their own memory spaces, and
have no (recursive) need for a keepeer.</em>
<p> One of the problems with the EROS keeper design is making it
terminate. This note describes the problem and our solution.  The
question is: <em>What happens the first time a keeper is invoked?</em>
<p> On a machine like the x86, where the register set is heavily
constrained, the keeper will not be able to proceed without modifying
it's data space.  The question is, where does this private data come
from?  At first glance, it cannot come from a keeper, because that
keeper would in turn fault the first time it was invoked, and so on
and on.
<p> The solution is surprisingly straightforward.  All segment faults
are restartable -- indeed, the typical behavior of the segment keeper
will be to request that the faulting operation be restarted.  The
segment keeper can therefore be coded as:
<ul>
  <pre>
OnFirstEntry:
     Initialize myself
     set return order code to OK, which will
       cause refault
ReturnToCaller:
     return to caller
AllSubsequentInvocations:
     process fault
     determine return code
     jump to 
     
  </pre>
</ul>
<h2>Self-Bootstrap</h2>
<p> The problem is now reduced to the initialization phase.  The trick
is to ensure that the keeper can purchase it's own stack and working
storage.  Having done so, it can safely restart the faulter in order
to actuall field the request..  The trick is that it must contrive to
purchase this storage <em>before</em> it in any way alters it's data
space.
<p> The following is a cut at x86 pseudo-code to do this.  If it can
be done on a machine with this small a register set, it can be done on
anything.
<ul>
<pre>
OnFirstEntry:
    ; Key register conventions:
    ;    KR1   node key to red segment
    ;    KR2   fault key from caller
    ;    KR3   red seg space bank key (from slot 12)
    ;    KR4   register for purchased objects
    ;    KR5   node key to node that will hold stack
    ;

    ; Fetch space bank key from red segment node into a key
    ; register.  Buy a page from it, and locate that page
    ; as the top of our stack.  A key to the node that will
    ; contain the top-of-stack page is assumed to be in a
    ; well-known key register (in this code KR3)

    ; This code further assumes that the key in slot 2 is a
    ; node key, which will be true if we were fabricated by
    ; a red segment factory.

    ; We assume that the initial exit block accepted the node
    ; key into KR1.  Invoke that key to load the space bank key
    ; into KR2.  Space bank key is in slot 12 of red segment node

    movl $1,%invokedKey          ; invoke red seg node
    movl $12,%orderCode          ; fetch key 12
    movl $0x0,%entryBlock        ; send no data, no keys
    movl $0x00030000,%exitBlock  ; acccept RK0 into KR3, no data
    movl $0x01110000,%invCtl     ; CALL, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation

    ; Now buy a page from the SpaceBank:
    movl $3,%invokedKey          ; invoke space bank
    movl $1,%orderCode           ; buy a page
    movl $0x0,%entryBlock        ; send no data, no keys
    movl %0x00040000,%exitblock  ; accept RK0 into KR4, no data
    movl $0x01110000,%invCtl     ; CALL, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation

    ; *That* might have failed. Check the return code.
    cmp  $0,%returnCode
    je  gotFirstPage

    ; first page fetch failed. Pass the return code back
    ; to the invoker via the fault key.
    movl $2,%invokedKey          ; the fault key
    movl %returnCode,%orderCode  ; pass the buck to domain keeper
    movl $0x0,%entryBlock        ; send no data, no keys
    movl $0x21000000,%exitBlock  ; accept usual key arguments but no string
    movl $0x00110000,%invCtl	 ; REPLY, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation

    jmp OnFirstEntry

GotFirstPage:
    movl $5,%invokedKey          ; invoke stack seg node
    movl $31,%orderCode          ; swap key 15
    movl $0x00040000,%entryBlock ; send no data, KR4 (the page key)
    movl $0x00000000,%exitBlock  ; acccept no data, no keys
    movl $0x01110000,%invCtl     ; CALL, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation

    movl $0x00100000,%exitString ; well known address, top of stack page
    subl $32,%exitString         ; size of usual entry arg
    movl %exitString,%esp        ; stack starts below that
    pushl %exitString

    ; FROM HERE ON WE CAN CALL C CODE.
    call FinishInitialization

    popl %exitString
    movl $2,%invokedKey          ; the fault key
    movl 0,%orderCode            ; force caller to retry
    movl $0x0,%entryBlock        ; send no data, no keys
    movl $0x21000020,%exitBlock  ; accept usual key arguments WITH STRING
    movl $0x00110000,%invCtl	 ; REPLY, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation

    ; Push arguments for normal RETURN invocation:
NormalEntry:
    ........
    movl $0x00110000,%invCtl	 ; REPLY, snd from string, rcv to string
    int  $0x31                   ; do invocation
    jmp NormalEntry
</pre>
</ul>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p> This approach works only if the following conditions are
maintained:
<ul>
  <li> The "buy a page" order on the space bank must not require a
       data argument.  Actually, a constant argument (one that can be
       provided in read-only fashion) is okay.
       <p>
  <li> The node copy and node swap operations must not require data
       arguments.
       <p> 
  <li> The fault key must not require data arguments.
       <p>
  <li> There must exist a version of the key invocation trap that does
       not require use of the stack.
       <p>
</ul>
<p> All of these are desirable in any case.  The last implies that on
machines like the x86 we may want to have two invocation paths.
