  <h1>Autoconfiguration in the EROS Kernel</h1>
</center>
<p> This note describes the autoconfiguration mechanism of the EROS
kernel.  Unlike most kernels, EROS performs a minimal kernel
configuration, and leaves it to user level code to configure the
remainder of the system.  This simplifies the addition of new hardware
by minimizing the opportunities for resource conflicts, and reduces
the number of cards that the kernel must know about.
<p> The autoconfiguration process must accomplish several tasks:
<ul>
  <li> It must establish the list of drivers that have been configured
       into the kernel, and build a table that allows it to map from
       device keys to the associated drivers.
  <li> It must reserve resources, such as DMA buffers, that may be
       needed by devices that will later be configured by a user-level
       domain.
  <li> It must identify the console port, which is usually a memory
       mapped display but may in some cases turn out to be a serial
       port.
  <li> It must locate and initialize all disk controller cards, and
       build the necessary tables that will allow it to later mount
       these disk units.
  <li> As it proceeds, it must construct a list of the resources that
       have been reserved by each configured driver.
</ul>
<h2>1 How Configuration Works</h2>
<p> Configuring an EROS system involves both compile-time and run-time
decision making.  At compile time, the person building the kernel
decides which kernel modules are to be included in the kernel.  Kernel
modules include
<ul>
  <li> Kernel tasks which may not be needed in all implementations.
       Some debugging related tasks, for example, can usefully be
       configured in and out of the system.
  <li> Drivers for kernel-managed devices.  This includes all disk
       controllers and disk devices, terminal devices, low-level
       network interfaces, and the console device.
  <li> Drivers for user-managed devices.  User managed devices are not
       started by the kernel, but can be initialized or shut down by
       user level code.
</ul>
<p> The kernel module list determines what devices will be recognized
by the EROS kernel.  In a typical configuration, there will be more
drivers than actual devices.
<p> The presence of a <em>driver</em> does not necessarily imply the
presence of the corresponding <em>device</em>.  If the device driver
is configured, the device can be recognized and manipulated if it is
actually present.  Because different systems have radically different
device configurations, the initially installed kernel configuration
includes device drivers for many different types of disk controllers.
Just one or two of these drivers will actually be used on most
systems.
<p> To decide what devices are actually present and configure the
kernel properly, the kernel makes two passes through the list of
kernel modules.  The first pass is the <em>probe</em> pass.  During
this pass, the module should perform several actions:
<ul>
  <li> It should determine whether the module should be configured
       into the kernel.  For kernel tasks, this is trivial (the answer
       is always yes).  For device drivers, the driver should be
       configured only if the corresponding device is present.
  <li> It should reserve any necessary resources, such as interrupt
       vectors, memory ranges, DMA channels, and regions in the I/O
       address space.
  <li> It should mark the module as <strong>present</strong>, which
       will cause the second pass to be made for this device.
</ul>
<p> Once the kernel knows what modules are to be configured, it makes
a second pass to actually <strong>attach</strong> the modules.  During
this pass, the module is responsible for performing any necessary
subsidiary configuration.  Disk controllers, for example, should probe
for and attach any drives that are present.
<p> The probe pass and the attach pass are separated for two reasons:
<ul>
  <li> On some machines, the results of the probe pass are needed to
       properly initialize the bus (e.g. VAX Unibus)
  <li> Some supporting code in the kernel makes use of the number of
       various types of controller to make decisions about buffer
       allocation at startup time.  These buffers must be allocated
       before the attach pass, because they must be used by the attach
       logic.
</ul>
<p> 
<h2>2 The Module List</h2>
<p> The master module list for a kernel is found in an architecture
specific subdirectory (we're about to change where it lives, and I'll
update this when it settles).  This list names the set of modules that
are to be configured into the kernel.  The <code>CONFIG</code> file is
included by various source files in the kernel code to cause the right
sorts of configuration to happen.
<p> Entries in this file take the form:
<ul>
  <strong>MODULE(name, "user readable name")</strong>
</ul>
<p> The <strong>name</strong> field indicates what kernel symbol name
can be used to locate the module.  The entry:
<p> Entries in this file take the form:
<ul>
  <strong>MODULE(IdleThread, "Idle Thread")</strong>
</ul>
says that some kernel object file publishes an <code>AutoConf</code>
structure whose name is <code>AutoConfModule</code>.  In the
corresponding module source file, there should be a source line that reads:
<ul>
  <strong>DEFMODULE(IdleThread,</strong>
  <em>ProbeRoutine</em><strong>,</strong>
  <em>AttachRoutine</em><strong>,</strong>);
</ul>
<p> Modules that require no interrupt, address space, DMA, or I/O port
resources can specify <code>TrivialProbe</code> as their probe
routine.
<h3>2.1 The Probe Routine</h3>
<p> The basic job of the <code>Probe()</code> routine is to determine
if a particular module should be configured into the kernel, and to
reserve any resources necessary for the support of that module.  In
the case of device driver modules, the probe function must perform the
following steps:
<ol>
  <li> Decide whether the hardware device is present, using whatever
       means are appropriate for the target architecture.
  <li> Reserve any necessary interrupt vector(s) for the device.
  <li> Reserve the portion of the memory map used by the device.
  <li> Reserve the motherboard DMA channel(s) (if any) used by the
       device.
  <li> Reserve the portion of the I/O port address space (if any) used
       by the device.
  <li> Register the device in the kernel device table so that
       invocations of the associated device key can be directed to the
       appropriate module.
  <li> Mark the module as <strong>present</strong>, so that it's
       <code>Attach()</code> routine will be run.
</ol>
<p> If any of these steps cannot be successfully performed, the probe
routine should relinquish any allocated resources and should not mark
the device as present.  This very important.  The IDE driver, for
example, checks for the presence of IDE drives and an IDE-managed
floppy disk.  If these are present, it allocates the associated port
space and binds the FD and HD device keys. In this event, the HD and
FD drivers must <em>not</em> be configured.  If no IDE controller is
present, the HD and FD device drivers will find the corresponding
ports unbound, and should proceed with configuration.
<p> While it may be necessary to temporarily enable interrupts for the
device during the probe phase, interrupts for the associated device
should be <em>disabled</em> at the end of this phase.  In principle,
the device is not prepared to handle interrupts until it's
<code>Attach()</code> routine has been called.
<p> Modules that are unconditionally configured can avoid the cost of
providing individual probe routines by using the
<code>TrivialProbe()</code> routine instead.  This is appropriate when
all resources used by the module are preallocated by kernel
convention.
<p> A few modules provide support for motherboard components or
exception handlers that must be present early in the system's
configuration phase for error handling.  These modules violate the
rule about interrupt enabling.  For example, the PageFault handler is
a module that is fully ocnfigured and installed by it's probe phase,
and supplies no <code>Attach()</code> routine.
<h3>2.2 The Attach Routine</h3>
<p> The <code>Attach()</code> routine complements the probe routine.
Where the probe routine allocates system resources associated with a
module, the attach routine initializes the module itself.  During the
attach routine, the module (or device) should be set to an initial
known state, and all necessary data structures should be allocated.
If the module is a device driver for a controller, it should perform
unit discovery during this phase.  For example, the IDE driver
discovers what disk drives are attached on each channel during this
phase.
<p> Modules that provide low-level motherboard support, or that
require no data structure initialization, can provide a NULL attach
routine.
