  <H1>Small Spaces for the x86 Family</H1>
</center>
<p class=initial> This note describes how we have adapted the ideas
from Liedtke's small address space paper [<a href="#ref1"
target="references">1</a>] for EROS.
<H2>1. The Small Spaces Idea</H2>
<p class=initial>
The basic idea behind small spaces relies on the availability of the
x86 segmentation mechanism.  Just as the EROS kernel is mapped in
common in all address spaces, we can map a number of <em>user</em>
regions into all address spaces.  Access to these regions can be
controlled with the segment registers.  A process can first be
allocated to one of these regions, and can be moved to a traditional
address space if it is discovered not to fit in the so-called ``small
space.''
<p>
Norm Hardy and I first did a design for small address spaces for EROS
in 1991.  This fell out of a larger conversation in which we were
trying to figure out how to let an EROS process believe that it owned
the full 4Gbyte virtual address space.  Our technique was to have a
region that the kernel lived in, but bounce this region around on
demand when the process wanted those virtual addresses.  In the end, I
concluded that the complexity of the kernel bounce logic outweighed
its benefit, and decided to settle for a 3 GByte address space for
EROS processes on the x86.  This, at least, is 1 GByte more than any
of the major operating systems, and leaves enough spare room for
kernel emulation within the target process address space if desired.
<p>
A side effect was that we realized that small spaces were possible.
We did <em>not</em> at that time appreciate their performance impact,
or we would have implemented them at the time.  We did not publish
this design.  Since I had many other things to implement at the time,
I set it aside intending to go back to it later.  Jochen Liedtke
arrived at the idea independently, and in 1995 put out a paper
describing an implementation of it for L4.  His performance numbers
were very impressive, and I resolved to implement them in EROS as
well.
<p>
The existence of small spaces can be discovered by means of the
<em>load segment limit</em> operation, but we consider this a
reasonable tradeoff.  If it is helpful, the operating system can
implement several sizes of small space (e.g. a large number of 128 Kbyte
spaces and a smaller number of 1 Mbyte spaces).  The current EROS
implementation includes only a single size: 128 Kbyte.
<p>
There are several advantages to small spaces:
<ul>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       Many programs, most notably keepers, will fit within them.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       A context switch into a small space or back to the most
       recently active ordinary space does not need to flush the
       TLB. This alone reduces the context switch cost by nearly 140
       cycles in practice.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       Cross-space copy is simplified by eliminating the need to
       walk the recipient address tables by hand.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       Since EROS is intended to promote an architectural discipline
       of many small objects, a great many EROS domains fall within
       the small space size limit.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       (Corollary)  Small spaces substantially reduce the demand for
       page table page frames.
       </p>
  </li>
</ul>
A minor disadvantage is that a process must (in our current
implementation) rebuild it's mapping tables when it exceeds the small
space size limits.
<h2>2. Planned Implementation</h2>
<p class=initial>
Much to my surprise, the implementation of small spaces looks to be
very simple.  The address map for the kernel was rearranged, and I
corrected a number of places where assumptions about the previous
virtual address had managed to creep into the code.
<h3>2.1. Changes to Address Mappings</h3>
<p class=initial>
In the EROS implementation of small spaces, the address space is
divided into three regions:
<center>
<pre>
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| Large Space  | Small Spaces | Kernel Virtual |
|   (unique)   |   (shared)   |    (shared)    |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
</pre>
</center>
Small spaces and kernel space are shared across all virtual maps,
enabling rapid transition to/from kernel and to/from small spaces.
<h3>2.1. Changes to the <tt>Process</tt> Structure</h3>
<p class=initial>
I added three new fields to the <tt>Process</tt>
structure:
<pre>
struct Process {
   ...
   uva_t   limit;      /* uppermost virtual address */
   uva_t   bias;       /* true VA = process VA + bias */
   PTE     *smallPTE;  /* true VA = process VA + bias */
};
</pre>
While the <tt>limit</tt> information can be obtained by inquiring of
the segment register itself, it is faster to load it from the
<tt>Process</tt> structure.  The <tt>bias</tt> is process specific,
and must be applied to sent and received string addresses during
string transfer in order for the kernel to reference the memory map in
the correct place.  
<p>
Previous to this change, the lower bound of string addresses and
argument blocks was not checked by the fast-path IPC code.  Since the
uppermost pages of kernel virtual space were unmapped, arithmetic
rollover guaranteed that an invalid lower bound would result in a page
fault.  Rather than place unmapped buffer regions between small spaces
I elected to pack them densely and start checking the lower bounds.
<p>
Every EROS <tt>Process</tt> might potentially be a small (128 Kbyte)
space.  Since a 128 Kbyte space takes only 32 page tables to map, I
decided to simply dedicate a special collection of page tables.  These
page tables are mapped into every process and also into the
kernel-special address space.  Every <tt>Process</tt> carries with it
32 dedicated PTE entries.
<p>
When the <tt>Process</tt> structure is first loaded, the
<tt>smallPTE</tt> field is initialized to point to the first entry.
If this field is nonzero, the associated process resides in a small
space, and no page table root pointer is loaded on return to the
process.  The net effect is that the small space runs parasitically in
all address spaces, which is what we wanted.
<h3>2.2. Changes to Context Switch</h3>
<p class=initial>
The new context switch logic must update the global descriptor table
with the correct base and bound for the small space before switching
into it.  This amounts to rewriting four words, all of which prove to
be in the same cache line.
<h3>2.3. Small Process Page Faults</h3>
<p class=initial>
When a process performs a page fault, the page fault code must now
check to see if the <tt>smallPTE</tt> field is nonzero.  If so, the
faulting process is a small process, and should not attempt to share
page tables.  A different path is taken for address resolution that
sidesteps the efficiencies of the main path, because in most cases a
small process will have only a single Node or Page as its entire
address space.
<p>
If the fault address exceeds the bound for this process, then one of
three things must be true:
<ul>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       The reference is into kernel space, and is therefore illegal.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       The address is bad, and a keeper must be invoked.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p class=initial>
       The address is valid, and the process must be transparently
       converted into a large space process.
       </p>
  </li>
</ul>
We defer changing the process into a large address space until we
discover a <em>valid</em> address outside the small space range.
There is no sense converting a process that will shortly go away in
any case.
<h3>2.2. Changes to IPC</h3>
<p class=initial>
The only other piece of code that needs to be touched is the fast and
slow IPC paths.  The slow IPC path needs to be updated to reflect the
new mapping table traversal logic.  The fast path needs to be taught a
new string transfer method.
