  <h1>Threads and Scheduling</h1>
</center>
<p> Threads are where the EROS scheduler and the abstractions
presented by the EROS kernel come together.  This note provides some
details on the role of threads in EROS, detailing some variations on
states that were somewhat obscure in KeyKOS.
<h2>1. What is a Thread?</h2>
<p> A thread defines a locus of computing.  Every allocated thread
occupies a process, and every running process is occupied by exactly
one thread.  EROS maintains a fixed-size table of threads.  The size
of this table can be changed at compile time, (though shrinking it can
create compatibility problems with the checkpoint area).
<p> Threads are allocated by the <strong>send</strong> operation.
They are deallocated by returning to a kernel capability or when the
process they occupy is found to be malformed.
<p> Each thread is in one of four states:

    <th align=left>State</th>
    <th align=left>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Free</strong></td>
    <td>The thread is not allocated, and can be allocated by a
      <strong>send</strong> operation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Running</strong></td>
    <td>The thread is currently active on some processor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Ready</strong></td>
    <td>The thread is waiting to be activated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Stalled</strong></td>
    <td>The thread is waiting for the availability of some resource,
      such as a page that is being paged in or the availability of
      some kernel data structure.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<h3>1.1. The Meaning of ``Ready''</h3>
<p> Note that the <strong>ready</strong> state does not correspond to
the usual sense of a ``ready process'' in conventional operating
systems.  The reason is that EROS processes are not kernel data
structures.  One consequence is that a thread can become ready when
it's associated process is not in core.  Indeed, one rationale
for separating threads from their processes is that the thread is a
much smaller data structure.
<p> A thread becomes <strong>ready</strong> under three conditions:
<ul>
  <li> When it's quanta expires, 
  <li> When it is preempted by a higher priority thread.
  <li> When some resource that it has stalled on becomes available, or
  <li> When it happens to have shared a resource stall queue with some
       other thread, and the <em>other</em> thread's resource has
       become available.
</ul>
<p> In order for a thread to be runnable, <em>all</em> of the
following conditions must be met:
<ul>
  <li> The thread must occupy a process that is in memory.
  <li> The thread must not be marked as needing to yield.
  <li> The process must be cached in the <code>context</code> cache.
  <li> The process must be well-formed.
</ul>
<p> A ready thread sits in the ready queue until it comes to the
front, at which time the kernel attempts to <em>activate</em> the
thread.
<h3>1.2. Thread Activation</h3>
In the worst case, where the associated process has been
paged out, activating the thread involves the following steps:
<ol>
  <li> If necessary, the process capability within the thread
       structure is <em>prepared</em>, which brings the node that is
       the root of the process into memory.  This action may cause the
       thread to stall for I/O; it is treated as though the thread
       itself initiated the fault.
       <p> 
  <li> A context structure is allocated for the process root.
       <p> 
  <li> The context is <em>prepared</em>, which forces the following
       steps to be taken:
       <p> 
       <ol>
	 <li> The process capability registers node and any annex
	      nodes are faulted into memory if necessary.
	 <li> The process register state is loaded into the context
	      structure, from which it can be efficiently loaded onto
	      the processor itself.
       </ol>
       <p> 
       The context preparation can initiate several I/O's, which may
       again cause the thread to stall.
       <p> It is also possible that the process will be found to be
       malformed, in which case the occupying thread is freed.
       <p> 
</ol>
<p> At this point, the thread is ready to run.
<p> If the process has previously run, and remains well-formed, the
context structure will exist and have a valid <code>saveArea</code>
pointer, so in most cases, the steps described above can be collapsed
into a fairly cheap piece of code in the interrupt logic:
<pre>
if (thread->context && thread->context->saveArea &&
    !thread->shouldYield && !thread->context->faultCode)
  ... thread can run ...
else
  thread->Activate();  /* may call keeper, may reschedule */
</pre>
<p> If the process fault code is non-zero, the thread transits to the
keeper process, and xecution resumes there.
<p> The system guarantees that <code>Thread::Activate()</code>can
always return a runnable thread because the system maintains an
always-runnable idle thread for this purpose.
<p> The resulting state transition diagram looks like:

    <td><strong>Stalled</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Ready</strong></td>
    <td>A resource has become available, or the thread has been
      awakened from a multiplexed resource queue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Ready, Running</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Stalled</strong></td>
    <td>The thread could not be activated because the occupied process
      was not in memory.  The thread ends up stalled waiting for the
      pagein operation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Ready, Running</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Free</strong></td>
    <td>The thread now occupies a malformed process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Ready</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Running</strong></td>
    <td>The thread has been successfully activated, and can be set in
      motion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><strong>Running</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Ready</strong></td>
    <td>The thread has been preempted.</td>
  </tr>
