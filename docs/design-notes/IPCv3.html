	    <h1>Revised<sup>2</sup> IPC Design</h1>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    This note describes the third iteration of the EROS IPC
	    interface, which incorporates a design for scatter/gather
	    implementation.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1. Motivation</h2>
	  <p>
	    The first round of serious benchmarking for EROS included a file
	    emulation benchmark.  These measurements were done without a
	    fast IPC implementation.  In spite of this, file emulation
	    proved to be the <em>only</em> benchmark on which the EROS
	    performance was disappointing, but bulk data organization
	    remains a vital operation, and some analysis leads me to be
	    concerned that similar problems will arise in the networking
	    implementation as well:
	  </p>

	      <td>Create 0 Kbyte file</td>
	      <td>74.00 us</td>
	      <td>91.84 us</td>
	      <td>This is mostly due to the cost of the unoptimized IPC
		implementation</td>
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign="top">
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td nowrap>Create 10 Kbyte file</td>
	      <td>105.00 us</td>
	      <td>250.50 us</td>
	      <td>Due to combination of slow IPC and lack of
		scatter/gather.</td>
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	  <p>
	    The file system implementation must perform a <em>bcopy</em>
	    operation internally to move the data from the receive buffer to
	    its final resting place.  To learn the cost of varous
	    operations, I turned off the internal bcopy and also the
	    internal logic to determine the destination of the bcopy
	    (i.e. the indirection block traversal).  This let me get a
	    breakdown on the timings for various file sizes.  At 10k, the
	    breakdown was:
	  </p>
	  <table>
	    <tr valign="top">
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td><b>Basic IPC cost</b></td>
	      <td><b>Indirection block processing</b></td>
	      <td><b>Extra bcopy</b></td>
	      <td><b>Total</b></td>
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign="top">
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>137.86 us</td>
	      <td>34.38 us</td>
	      <td>75.76 us</td>
	      <td>249.00 us</td>
	      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	  <p>
	    The marginal bcopy translates into memory bandwidth of 135
	    Mbytes/sec, which is close enough to L1 in-cache bandwidth
	    that we can conclude the <em>bcopy</em> isn't broken.
	    This also suggests that if the implementation does
	    absolutely <em>nothing</em> else, we still can't afford to
	    move the data twice (once across the boundary, once to
	    final location) if matching Linux is even a goal.  Setting 
	    aside the merits of Linux, an awful lot of programs out
	    there manipulate files, so it's worthwhile for this to go 
	    fast.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    All of which pretty well dictates a scatter/gather IPC
	    implementation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Side observation: the need for a file-like abstraction
	    doesn't go away just because EROS is persistent.  There
	    remains still a need for an interchange format.  Database
	    programs probably get off the hook, but most applications
	    do not.
	  </p>
	  <h2>2. Interface Revision for Scatter/Gather</h2>
	  <p>
	    While I plan to rearrange the x86 IPC layout again, the
	    basic interface isn't changed in a major way by
	    introducing scatter gather.  The common case is still a
	    contiguous buffer -- especially on the sender side -- and
	    it makes sense to avoid validating an indirection
	    descriptor block when none is necessary.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Revised Interface</h3>
	  <p>
	    In the IPCv2 specification, the <code>rcv len</code> and
	    <code>snd len</code> fields of the IPC descriptor are
	    limited to maximum values of 65536.  The payload must be
	    bounded to ensure that all of the data will stay in memory 
	    at once, and in practical terms it's not useful to make it 
	    much larger than this.  At 64k transfer sizes the limiting 
	    factor is the data cache, and at anything much above 32k
	    it's cost-acceptable for the programs to set up a shared
	    memory buffer.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Given all of which, I plan to redefine the <code>rcv
	    len</code>, <code>rcv ptr</code>, <code>snd len</code>,
	    and <code>snd ptr</code> fields as follows:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		On entry, positive values of <code>rcv len</code> and
		<code>snd len</code> will continue to describe a
		contiguous region of transmitted (received) data.  In
		this case, the <code>rcv ptr</code> and <code>snd
		ptr</code> fields point to the data exactly as they do
		now.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		On entry, <em>negative</em> values of <code>rcv
		len</code> and <code>snd len</code> indicate that the
		<code>rcv data</code> (respectively: <code>snd
		data</code>) pointers point to scatter (gather)
		descriptor block, and that the absolute value of the
		<code>rcv len</code> or <code>snd len</code> value is
		the <em>number of bytes</em> in the scatter (gather)
		descriptor block.  If the length given is not a
		multiple of the descriptor size, the last descriptor
		will not be used.  At most 64 descriptors can be
		included in the scatter/gather descriptor block.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		On exit, <code>rcv len</code> will continue to hold
		the total number of bytes transferred.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In the short term, I may choose to implement the
	    scatter/gather logic only in the slow (i.e. general) IPC
	    path.  If you're using this logic at all you're almost
	    certainly dominated by transfer cost, so optimizing the
	    associated context switch seems a bit silly.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Scatter/Gather Descriptors</h3>
	  <p>
	    The scatter (gather) descriptor blocks  consist of
	    (length, pointer) pairs:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <pre>
+-----------------+  offset 0
| length in bytes |
+-----------------+  offset 4
| pointer to data |
+-----------------+  offset 8
| length in bytes |
+-----------------+  offset 12
| pointer to data |
+-----------------+
     ...
	    </pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    To limit the number of pages that must be in memory for
	    the IPC to proceed, the total number of descriptor pairs
	    may not excede 32.  This is substantially too large for
	    comfort, as it allows up to 128 pages to be implicated on
	    each side of a transfer.  On the other hand, it appears to
	    be necessary in support of certain applications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Regardless of the lengths specified in the scatter/gather
	    descriptor blocks, no more than 65536 bytes will be
	    transferred in a single IPC operation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is the responsibility of the recipient to ensure that 
	    the receive scatter descriptor, if any, does not overlap
	    the receive buffer areas.  If the scatter descriptor
	    overlaps any of the specified receive areas, <em>no</em>
	    bytes will be received, and the recipient will recieve an
	    <code>FC_ParmLack</code> fault code.
	  </p>
	  <h2>3. Incidental Modifications: x86 Family</h2>
	  <p>
	    In the IPCv2 specification, I changed the interface
	    specification so that several of the IPC parameters were
	    passed on the stack.  In doing so, I failed to take
	    advantage of a number of opportunities that this
	    presents.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Fast IPC aside, the practice in EROS has proven to be that
	    real capability invocations use stub procedures.  On the
	    x86, for lack of registers, these procedures build an
	    on-stack data structure describing the IPC.  This
	    structure is in turn passed to the IPC assembly stub
	    routine, which selectively loads some of the values into
	    memory.  Once into the kernel, values are lifted off of
	    the stack and placed in pseudo-registers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For receive-related parameters, the pseudo-registers are
	    necessary and appropriate, as it is desirable to avoid
	    revalidating the IPC block every time a recipient is
	    invoked.  For send-related parameters, the
	    pseudo-registers are well and truly silly; either the IPC
	    will fail and be restarted, or it will proceed and these
	    parameters will become dead values.  The send descriptor
	    block must be validated in any case, so we might as well
	    take these parameters from their original locations on the 
	    stack.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Given which, I now plan to reconcentrate the send-side
	    parameters on the stack and lift them directly from
	    there.  The revised IPC register layout on the x86 is as
	    follows:

	  <p>
	    The layout shown here has the additional advantage that it does
	    not clobber %ebp, which is useful in speeding up the IPC path.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    An incidental benefit to this layout is that it allows me
	    to realign the send/receive key fields on byte boundaries,
	    making them a good bit easier to validate and extract.
