	    <h1>The Capability Invocation Path</h1>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    This note describes a significant reformulation of the
	    EROS capability invocation path.  In particular, it
	    describes how the difficult corner conditions are handled
	    without impeding the main code.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
	  <p>
	    The EROS/KeyKOS/GNOSIS capability invocation path
	    semantics is complex (perhaps too complex).  Here are some
	    of the semantic complications:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Invoking a process capability with a SEND operation
		causes a new thread of control to be created.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Performing a RETURN on a kernel object capability with
		a resume capability <b>rsm(xx)</b> in slot 3 causes
		control to be returned to process <b>xx</b> rather
		than to you.  This is in marked contrast to "system
		call" style interfaces, where control returns to the
		caller eventually (though POSIX fork/exec are
		similar).
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Performing a RETURN on a kernel object capability
		<em>without</em> a resume capability in slot 3 retires
		the invoking thread of control <em>unless</em> it
		proves that we have invoked a kept red segment key.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Performing a SEND on a kernel object where capability
		argument 3 <em>is not</em> a resume capability causes
		the return value(s) returned by the kernel object to be
		made to vanish, even though the invoker continues to
		execute (SEND returns no arguments).
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Performing a SEND on a kernel object where capability
		argument 3 <em>is</em> a resume capability
		<b>rsm(xx)</b> has the return values delivered to
		<b>xx</b>, but also creates a new thread of control
		for the invoker.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Performing <em>any</em> invocation on a red segment
		key may invoke it's keeper, but unlike the previous
		cases the fact that control is returning to another
		process cannot be immediately discerned from the
		arguments presented at the call.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		A few kernel objects permute or swap capabilities. If
		the invoker and the invokee are the same then juggling
		the capabilities can become very interesting.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		A few kernel operations can alter the runnability of a
		process -- in particular can alter the runnability of
		the invokee.  This means that a perfectly good invokee
		may no longer be runnable by the time we are ready to
		transfer control to it.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If the invokee was named by a fault capability, all
		result value(s) of the operation should be discarded.
		More precisely, they should be treated as though they
		are a fault capability invocation, which has
		"distinctive" semantics.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    This note describes how these corner cases are handled by
	    the kernel.
	  </p>
	  <h1>2. Synopsis of Solution</h1>
	  <p>
	    All of these cases can be reduced to a couple of bits of
	    knowledge a few special cases:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		What capability is being invoked?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Which process (if any) will receive control when the
		invocation is done?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		To which process (if any) should results go?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Should the invoker continue execution (i.e. is this a
		SEND operation)?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Is the present operation one of the few that might
		mangle the invokee?  If so, this is dealt with by the
		code that implements the operation.  Handling this is
		straightforward, so we will ignore this issue from
		here on.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In older implementations of EROS, all of this was managed
	    by ensuring that results went to a temporary holding
	    buffer.  A boolean was tracked indicating whether transfer
	    of these results to the final recipient should be
	    suppressed (to handle fault capabilities), and the output
	    process could be nullified, signifying either that it had
	    ceased to be runnable or that the invocation was a SEND on
	    a kernel object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This implementation has several problems:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Molasses in January is faster.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Results are copied even when it isn't necessary.  It
		proves not to be necessary most of the time.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		A boatload of complexity is introduced into various
		pieces of code to see that this side structure --
		which can hold capabilities -- is properly handled
		during consistency checking and key ring management.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The design necessitates setting up the side buffer in
		the common path.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    A conversation with Norm at one point suggested an
	    extremely elegant alternative: <em>use a shadow
	    process</em>.  In this design, the "context" of an
	    invocation tracks four pieces of information:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	      <pre>
struct Invocation {
  Key     *key;     // the key invoked
  Process *invoker; // the invoking process
  Process *invokee; // the receiver of control
  Process *target;  // the receiver of results
};
	      </pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    An entry in the process cache (actually, one per processor
	    on an SMP) is reserved to serve as a "shadow" process.
	    The <tt>key</tt> and <tt>invoker</tt> fields are set in
	    the obvious way.
	    The <tt>invokee</tt> and <tt>target</tt> are initially set
	    according to the invocation type:
	  </p>
	  <center>
	    <table>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td><b>Invocation</b></td>
		<td><b>Invokee</b></td>
		<td><b>Target</b></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>CALL</td>
		<td><tt>invoker</tt></td>
		<td><tt>invokee</tt></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>RETURN</td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><em>if</em> <b>rsm(xx)</b> <em>in arg 3</em></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>RETURN</td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><tt>&amp;shadowProc</tt></td>
		<td><em>if</em> <b>fault(xx)</b> <em>in arg 3</em></td>
		<td>(unimplemented)</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>RETURN</td>
		<td><tt>0</tt></td>
		<td><tt>&amp;shadowProc</tt></td>
		<td><em>otherwise</em></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>SEND</td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><em>if</em> <b>rsm(xx)</b> <em>in arg 3</em></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>RETURN</td>
		<td><tt>xx</tt></td>
		<td><tt>&amp;shadowProc</tt></td>
		<td><em>if</em> <b>fault(xx)</b> <em>in arg 3</em></td>
		<td>(unimplemented)</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr valign=top>
		<td>SEND</td>
		<td><tt>0</tt></td>
		<td><tt>&amp;shadowProc</tt></td>
		<td><em>otherwise</em></td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </center>
	  <p>
	    The fault key cases are unimplemented primarily because I
	    cannot really see a situation in which the results of a
	    kernel object invocation can rationally be directed to a
	    fault key.  A corollary of this is that the
	    <em>returner</em> also should not permit this.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If it is subsequently discovered that this was an
	    invocation of a kept red segment key, then the
	    <tt>key</tt> field is updated to name the gate key to the
	    keeper, and both <tt>invokee</tt> and <tt>target</tt> are
	    revised to name the process named by the gate key.
	  </p>
	  <h1>3. Invocation Processing</h1>
	  <p>
	    Given section (2) as preface, it is now possible to
	    describe how invocation proceeds.
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The invocation trap is taken and the process registers
		are saved.  We switch to the kernel stack.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The capability invocation arguments are syntax
		checked.  This involves bounds checking the capability
		entry/exit vectors and verifying that the invocation
		type falls in the range [0..2].  We also do an upper
		bound check on the entry string, but not on the exit
		string, as the upper bound on that is implied by the
		presence of an upper bound on the entry string.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The invoked capability is determined.  The capability
		type byte is extracted.  The invocation type is OR'd
		into the resulting value.  We now have an index into a
		table of the form:
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		  <pre>
captype 0:  { return_op, call_op, send_op, unused }
		  </pre>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		We set the invoker state to <b>waiting</b> in the
		optimistic hope that this is a CALL operation, write
		the invocation context structure as described for the
		CALL operation, and dispatch through the table.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If it is <em>not</em> a call operation, we will end up
		in the generic return handler or the generic send
		handler.  These are wrappers that reset the invoker
		state, examine the capability in slot 3, conditionally
		reset the invokee and target, and then call the
		handler specified in the CALL slot for that
		capability.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If the invocation was not a CALL, control eventually
		returns to the SEND or RETURN wrapper.
		The SEND wrapper fabricates a new thread for the invoker
		if necessary.  Both wrappers return to the main path.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		The main path now checks if <tt>invokee == 0</tt>, if
		so, it branches to the Yield entry stub.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Control now returns to invokee.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
