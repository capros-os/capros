		<p>
		  A number of issues, including ease of driver
		  porting, a strong desire for embedded real-time
		  support, and the need to build a more flexible and
		  configurable OS platform have led to significant
		  design changes in what will become EROS version
		  2.0. This note describes the motivation, the changes
		  that have been made, and the issues that these
		  changes raise for developers.
		</p>
	    </ul>
	    <h1>Introduction</h1>
	    <p>
	      Several needs have been converging for some time in the
	      EROS community:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  We need a wide array of drivers in order to make the
		  system useful and usable.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Several critical early users of EROS need embedded
		  and real-time support.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  From a research perspective, we need a system that
		  is both more configurable and more easily modified
		  than the original monolithic kernel design
		  permitted.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  From a personal standpoint, I needed to get out of
		  the kernel business so that students could make more
		  effective use of the system and I could focus more
		  effectively on my main jobs: research and teaching.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  There has been a need to look at issues of resource
		  arbitration, both as a matter of real-time support
		  and as a matter of research interest. Any monolithic
		  kernel design inherently contains a large body of
		  relatively non-preemptable code, which can be
		  thought of as a preferred scheduling class. For
		  effective real time support, it is useful if all
		  activities can be controlled by the same
		  scheduler. QNX, for example, gets a good deal of
		  leverage out of this.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      In brief, meeting these goals essentially required that
	      we move drivers from the kernel space to application
	      space. 
	    </p>
	    <h2>User Space Drivers</h2>
	    <p>
	      Unfortunately, moving drivers to user space carries
	      consequential damages: it breaks the persistence
	      model. If the core disk drivers are not included in the
	      kernel, then the kernel cannot rely on them for startup
	      purposes, and therefore must not rely on reading the
	      checkpoint area to get going.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I briefly considered retaining disk drivers in the
	      kernel, and moving only the other drivers out. This
	      proves to be an undesirable hybrid, because keeping
	      "only" the disk drivers is non-trivial. A SCSI disk, for
	      example, carries a lot of supporting code. Supporting
	      "only" SCSI disks would mean incorporating complete SCSI
	      bus, device, and logical unit support into the
	      kernel. There is then the problem of exporting
	      canonicalized interfaces for all <em>other</em> devices
	      on the SCSI bus. Worse, SCSI is a hot-pluggable
	      interface, so the kernel would need to deal with hot
	      plug policy.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Ironically, this last point proved to be the final straw
	      for the EROS v1.0 design. In thinking about the rising
	      popularity of USB, FireWire(tm), wireless, and similar
	      ad-hoc connectable bus technologies, I concluded that
	      keeping the supporting policies out of the kernel was
	      important, because it would need to change
	      frequently.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For these and other reasons, drivers in EROS v2.0 will
	      be user-space applications. The bootstrap code has been
	      modified to preload ranges containing the driver code,
	      and the kernel has been modified to start a single IPL
	      process that in turn starts all other drivers. That is,
	      the kernel no longer has any direct knowledge of disks,
	      disk-level object management, or storage representation.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Persistence</h2>
	    <p>
	      Removing drivers -- in particular the disk drivers --
	      from the kernel immediately led to a second problem: how
	      would checkpointing and persistence be implemented for
	      those system configurations that needed them? This
	      raised issues about where to make the "cut" between the
	      kernel and the user-mode object store, and how to ensure
	      that deadlocks did not occur between the kernel and the
	      object management code. Getting this interface
	      appropriately defined proved tricky.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Mixed-mode Programming</h2>
	    <p>
	      One consequence of moving drivers to user-land was the
	      need to introduce a non-persistent programming model for
	      EROS. To avoid deadlock, the kernel must not attempt to
	      checkpoint the state of drivers. If, for example, the
	      disk driver state were checkpointed, the kernel could
	      conceivably get into a corner where the disk driver data
	      had been marked copy on write but no page frames are
	      available. In this circumstance, progress cannot be made
	      until the disk driver runs, and the disk driver cannot
	      run until the copy on write completes.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Oddly enough, the deadlock problem above is probably
	      solvable. The issue that convinced me to make drivers
	      non-persistent was initialization. It is extremely
	      awkward if drivers restart from partially checkpointed
	      states, because you then cannot rely on the driver to
	      correctly bootstrap the rest of the system. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Ultimately, the solution was to introduce a
	      non-persistent programming mechanism. The kernel now can
	      be compiled entirely without persistence. If the kernel
	      compilation <em>includes</em> persistence support, it is
	      now possible to have ranges of objects that are excluded
	      from persistence and/or ageing. Objects excluded from
	      persistence will remain resident in memory once
	      dirtied. Objects excluded from ageing will remain in
	      memory whether or not they are dirty.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Non-persistent regions create still further
	      complications: If a persistent process calls a
	      non-persistent process directly, it can be checkpointed
	      before the non-persistent process returns. If the system
	      then crashes, the resume capability to this process can
	      be lost, with the end result that the calling process
	      will never restart. New mechanisms have been introduced
	      to manage the boundary crossing between persistent and
	      non-persistent regions.
	    </p>
	    <h2><a name="physmem">Physical Memory Regions</a></h2>
	    <p>
	      User-space drivers have also dictated a need for some
	      way to publish physical memory for use by selected
	      applications. Without knowing the physical addresses of
	      certain pages, drivers cannot correctly program DMA
	      subsystems. A well-known range of OIDs has been reserved
	      for physical pages, and a new (user-mode) physical
	      memory allocator has been introduced to permit drivers
	      to allocate contiguous physical memory regions. This is
	      described in greater detail below.
	    </p>
	    <h1>Object Sources</h1>
	    <p>
	      A reasonably pleasant solution to several of these
	      problems emerged in the introduction of <b>object
	      sources</b>. In EROS version 1, we used to say that the
	      in-memory object cache was a cache of the disk ranges as
	      modified by the checkpoint area. In EROS version 2, we
	      now think of the object cache is a cache of object
	      sources.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      An object source provides a relatively simple interface:
	    </p>
	    <table>
	      <tbody>
		<tr valign="top">
		  <td>Method</td>
		  <td>Purpose</td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign="top">
		  <td><code>GetObject(oid, type,<br>&nbsp;count, useCount)</code></td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Return the object coresponding to
		      <code>oid</code>, whose exected type is
		      <code>type</code> (page or node). If
		      <code>useCount</code> is true, the returned object
		      should be returned only of the value of
		      <code>count</code> matches the allocation count of
		      the object.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      The kernel still makes the assumption that
		      objects are divided into page frames. If the
		      requested <code>type</code> does not match the
		      current type of the containing page frame for
		      this <code>oid</code>, the kernel is requesting
		      that the object source retag the frame as
		      containing objects of the requested type.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      When a retag is requested, the kernel is also
		      promising that the kernel currently holds no
		      objects residing in the relevant
		      frame. Therefore, the object store may assume
		      that it holds a consistent view of the current
		      content of the frame.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      The object source may refuse to retag the
		      frame. For example, the object range for
		      physical memory pages will not retag. Since the
		      spacebank implementation relies on retagging,
		      such ranges should not be managed by the space
		      bank.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign="top">
		  <td><code>WriteBack(objectHeader)</code></td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Take the object identified by the kernel
		      <code>objectHeader</code> and write it back to
		      the object source. If the object source is
		      read-only, this request may be refused.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign="top">
		  <td><code>Invalidate(objectHeader)</code></td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Remove the specified object from the object
		      cache, whether or not it is dirty. Some object
		      sources, most notably the preload object source that
		      contains drivers, insist that all preloaded
		      objects remain resident, and will refuse this
		      request.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr valign="top">
		  <td><code>Rescind(objectHeader)</code></td>
		  <td>
		    <p>
		      Destroy the specified object. Even
		      non-invalidatable objects are removed when
		      destroyed.
		    </p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
	      </tbody>
	    </table>
	    <p>
	      While there are a few other supporting methods, these
	      are the main ones.
	    </p>
	    <h2>How Object Sources are Managed</h2>
	    <p>
	      The kernel maintains a list of ``attached'' object
	      sources. When searching for an object, this list is of
	      sources is consulted in order from first to last. The
	      first source that agrees to produce (consume) the object
	      is accepted. Thes list always begins with the
	      <code>ObCacheSource</code>, so objects that are already
	      loaded into the object cache will be found there.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Other object sources implemented by the version 2 kernel are:

		      <code>Invalidate()</code> and
		      <code>WriteBack()</code> operations.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      A future modification to the kernel will alter
		      the behavior of this range type to refuse both
		      invalidation and writeback. This is on the
		      grounds that since these objects are going to
		      remain in memory anyway it is better for them to
		      be preloaded into the in-memory object cache,
		      marked as non-evictable, and then reclaim the
		      space from the preloaded region for use as more
		      object cache space. That is, the current design
		      effectively pays twice for these objects, and it
		      shouldn't.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      The current implementation is done this way
		      because it was the fastest way to get a version
		      2 kernel working quickly, and we can live with
		      the double payment for a brief window of time.

		    <p>
		      The physical page source publishes a reserved
		      range of object identifiers that have a 1:1
		      correspondence with physical page frames. This
		      range is populated only where the in-memory
		      object cache has a valid frame for a page
		      object.  This isn't quite as simple as it
		      sounds.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      The complication with physical page ranges is
		      that the kernel is already using much of
		      physical memory, and it cannot simply move out
		      of the way on demand (though we are working to
		      improve on that to some degree). Also, any page
		      object that is presented for application use
		      must ahve an associated
		      <code>ObjectHeader</code> structure. This
		      structure is needed to hold the metadata (oid,
		      allocation count, and so forth) associated with
		      the page in question. The
		      <code>PhysPageSource</code> therefore will not
		      expose (e.g.) pages occupied by the kernel,
		      because these pages have no associated
		      <code>ObjectHeader</code> structures (we are
		      also considering a design modification to change
		      <em>that</em>, but less eagerly).
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Fortunately, the kernel already knows of a pool
		      of real page frames that <em>do</em> have associated
		      <code>ObjectHeader</code> structures: the page
		      frames that make up the slots for page objects
		      in the object cache. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Suppose that physical page frame
		      402 (i.e. the page frame whose starting physical
		      address is 402*PAGE_SIZE) is such a page frame.
		      In order to obtain a page key corresponding to
		      this page frame, the application wields the
		      range key to fabricate a page key whose OID
		      falls within the OID
		      range that is reserved to designate physical
		      page frames. That is, it attempts to fabricate a
		      page key whose OID is 
		      reserved_base + (402 << 8). The shift is to
		      translate the frame number into an OID value for
		      the corresponding frame.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      The requested capability will be fabricated
		      <em>only</em> if frame 402 is a valid frame slot
		      in the object cache. If so, the current resident
		      of that object cache slot is evicted (possibly
		      by claiming some <em>other</em> object cache
		      slot for it) and the slot is subsequently
		      claimed for use as a physical page. The
		      <code>PhysPageSource</code> refuses both
		      <code>WriteBack</code> and
		      <code>Invalidate</code> requests.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      This may all seem rather convoluted, but it is
		      sufficient to allow a relatively simple
		      user-level management application to allocate
		      and deallocate physical page ranges.

	    <h1>User Mode Drivers</h1>
	    <p>
	      A more detailed description of user-mode driver support
	      is given in <a href="UserDrivers.html">User Mode Drivers
	      in EROS 2.0</a>, but we will synopsize the key
	      supporting points here.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      First, the bootstrap code has been enhanced to preload
	      object ranges that have been marked with the
	      <code>DF_PRELOAD</code> flag. Such ranges are preloaded
	      into memory and the kernel is informed of their location
	      and OID ranges.  The kernel in turn fabricates
	      <code>PreloadObSource</code> instances for each of these
	      preloaded ranges. This mechanism is used to preload
	      drivers into memory. Drivers are started using the
	      application and driver startup mechanism described <a
	      href="#startup">below</a>. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In addition to the <code>PhysPageSource</code> support
	      described above, the EROS v2.0 kernel has been modified
	      to enable authorized applications to write device
	      registers, and also to allow them to wait for
	      interrupts. This allows drivers to block until an
	      interrupt on the desired device occurse, and then
	      perform appropriate programmed I/O and/or program a DMA
	      controller to perform the I/O.
	    </p>
	    <h1><a name="startup">Application and Driver Startup</a></h1>
	    <p>
	      Because EROS may now run in diskless environments, it is
	      no longer possible for the kernel to consult the
	      checkpoint area in order to determine what processes
	      should be started at boot time. In fact, the
	      responsibility for these restarts has been moved out of
	      the kernel entirely.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In EROS v2.0, the idea of the "IPL Key" has been
	      resurrected. The <b>IPL Key</b> is a process key stored
	      in the boot sector of the boot disk. It is passed along
	      from the bootstrap code to the kernel as part of the
	      bootstrap logic. Once the kernel is initialized, it
	      starts the process named by the IPL Key. The kernel
	      assumes that this process should simply be set running
	      and allowed to execute instructions.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In our current tutorials, the most common use of the IPL
	      Key is to include a copy of <code>ipltool.map</code into
	      the system image description file.  This cause the
	      <b>IPL Tool</b> process to be included in the system
	      image, and tells the image generator that the <b>IPL Key</b>
	      should be set to point to the <b>IPL Tool</b>
	      process. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The <b>IPL Tool</b> works in cahoots with the image
	      builder (the <b>mkimage</b> program). The <b>mkimage</b>
	      program builds up a linked list of nodes whose contents
	      are process keys. Wherever
	      <b>mkimage</b> encounters a <code>run</code> statement
	      in the image description. It appends a process key to
	      the end of this list. The start of the chain is held by
	      the <b>IPL Tool</b>. When the <b>IPL Tool</b> starts up,
	      it fabricates a fault capability to each process in turn
	      and then uses the fault capability to set that process
	      in motion. At the end of the chain the <b>IPL Tool</b>
	      exits.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In a purely embedded system, the IPL tool will likely
	      start all system processes. In a persistent system, the
	      IPL tool will probably be used to start up the
	      persistence layer, which may in turn start other
	      processes.

	    <h1>Driver Rendevous</h1>
	    <p>
	      <img src="../img/construction.gif" alt="Construction:"
		   align="left"> This description requires further
		   enhancement.
	    </p>
	    <br clear="left">
	    <p>
	      The final enhancement in the the EROS v2.0 kernel
	      architecture is the redesign of <b>Device</b>
	      capabilities. In the v1.0 kernel, devices were
	      implemented in the kernel, and a device capability was
	      ultimately bound to a particular piece of hardware. In
	      the v2.0 kernel, device capabilities simply reflect
	      requests up to a responsible driver.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The reason that device capabilities exist at all is the
	      problem of thread loss. If a persistent process is ever
	      permitted to directly invoke a non-persistent process,
	      and a checkpoint occurs at the wrong time, the
	      persistent process might never awaken. To resolve this,
	      we have introduced in-kernel device rendevous
	      objects. Device capabilities now name these rendevous
	      objects.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Rendevous objects provide a reflection service. The
	      driver calls the provider half of the rendevous object
	      with a <code>WaitForRequest</code> using one type of
	      device capability. The client, which can be either
	      persistent or non-persistent, calls a capability for the
	      client half of the rendevous object. Within the kernel,
	      control does not pass directly to the driver. Instead,
	      the caller is blocked on a stall queue and the driver
	      thread of control is released, receiving the information
	      passed by the client.
	    </p>
	    <h1><a name="checkpoint">Revisions to Checkpoint Mechanism</a></h1>
	    <p>
	      In the EROS v2, checkpointing can be entirely compiled
	      out. This may be appropriate for two types of
	      applications:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Purely ROMable applications, where there is no
		  storage subsystem available.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Applications in which the storage system does not
		  play a central role in the integrity of the
		  system.
		</p>
		<p>
		  For example, a digital camera might reasonably
		  manage its flash device in the style of a
		  conventional file system rather than using
		  checkpointing. As with a UNIX file system, this file
		  system would need to be checked for consistency at
		  power-up.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      If checkpointing is <em>included</em> in the kernel
	      build, the division of labor changes a bit relative to
	      the earlier kernel version:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The snapshot and stabilization phases are still
		  driven by the kernel, but of course all of the
		  associated disk I/O is accomplished by making
		  requests of the appropriate object source.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The checkpoint directory, the log itself, and the
		  entire migration process are now managed in
		  user-level code.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      A new capability will be introduced that will allow a
	      user-level object source to read and write objects into
	      the object cache. <em>This is a security-critical
	      interface,</em> because it essentially enables an
	      application to convert data (disk frames) into
	      capabilities by creating node objects from raw
	      bits. <em>A fundamental assumption is being made
	      here,</em> which is that the wielder of the object
	      source capability is trusted in the same way that a disk
	      driver would be.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Open Issue</H2>
	    <p>
	      There is an open issue in this design: placing the
	      checkpoint directory in user level code may introduce an
	      unacceptable performance delay, because the "fault on
	      first modify" that is performed to verify that an object
	      has enough space in the checkpoint area must now be
	      reflected to user mode. This is potentially a
	      bottleneck -- especially when restarting the system
	      following a snapshot.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For the moment, I'm going to try things as-is without
	      doing any optimization against this potential
	      bottleneck. If this proves to be a problem, the
	      interface to the application-level object source can
	      easily be redefined to move the responsibility for the
	      checkpoint accounting back into the kernel. Note that
	      the kernel does not need to know <em>where</em> the
	      objects are going. It only needs to know the bound on
	      the number of allowable dirty objects at any given
	      time.
	    </p>
	    <h1><a name="checkpoint">Kernel Malloc</a></h1>
	    <p>
	      The move to user drivers carries with it the
	      long-avoided adoption of a dynamic memory allocator for
	      the kernel. This is described in the <a
	      href="KernMalloc.html">Kernel Malloc</a> design note.
