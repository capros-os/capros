	      <h1>Kernel Output Design</h1>
	    </center>
	    <p>
	      This note describes the handling of kernel output in the
	      user-mode driver based design.
	    </p>
	    <h2>1. Background</h2>
	    <p>
	      The move to user-mode drivers has had an unforseen
	      casualty: the kernel debugger. This note describes what
	      we plan to do about it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I had hoped that it would be possible to somehow "share"
	      the console between the kernel debugger and the
	      user-land world, perhaps by switching screens back and
	      forth when the kernel debugger is in use.  This is
	      proving to be impossible. The ultimate source of the
	      problem is that the display is a shared memory device,
	      and there doesn't appear to be a simple protocol by
	      which the kernel and the user-mode software can agree
	      about who owns it -- or even about its current
	      resolution!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      On the x86, there is an additional challenge in the fact
	      that "windowed" access to the frame buffer is
	      hardware-specific. The net effect of this is that
	      putting the kernel debugger on the console forces you to
	      pull hardware-specific display drivers in as well.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The proposed solution is this: if the kernel debugger is
	      compiled in, it gets a dedicated device. This kernel
	      will inform the user-mode device setup code that this
	      device is unavailable.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      At present, we plan to provide three scenarios for the
	      kernel debugger:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  Not configured
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The console, keyboard pair
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The serial (tty0/COM1) port
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      If somebody needs tty0 at some point, we can easily add
	      the option to use tty1/COM2. We could also
	      straightforwardly introduce ethernet-based debugging at
	      some point.
	    </p>
	    <h2>2. Revised Kernel Output Logic</h2>
	    <p>
	      With this change in place, there is now a corresponding
	      change to the kernel's output logic. Here is the plan,
	      and the rationale.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The kernel uses three logically distinct output streams
	      in parallel: the <tt>syscon_stream</tt>, the
	      <tt>dbg_stream</tt>, and the <tt>log_stream</tt>.
	    </p>
	    <h3>2.1. The Log Stream</h3>
	    <p>
	      The <tt>log_stream</tt> is easiest to explain. The
	      kernel maintains a circular log buffer for
	      diagnostics. The purpose of this buffer is to have a
	      place for messages to go that will later be displayed by
	      a user-mode logging agent. Any kernel output that occurs
	      while the kernel debugger is inactive goes here.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Output generated while the kernel debugger is active
	      (i.e. in response to a debugger command) does
	      <em>not</em> go to the <tt>log_stream</tt>. The logic of
	      this is that these messages are "out of band" with
	      respect to the normal flow of the kernel.
	    </p>
	    <h3>2.2. Use of Console (<tt>syscon_stream</tt>)</h3>
	    <p>
	      The kernel assumes that the console display buffer (if
	      present) can be used freely by the kernel prior to the
	      point where the first user-mode thread is dispatched. If
	      a console display buffer is present, the global variable
	      <tt>syscon_stream</tt> is bound to a stream that
	      displays on the console. In order to provide information
	      about boot-up processing, the kernel issues diagnostics
	      to <tt>syscon_stream</tt>. If no console device is
	      present, <tt>syscon_stream</tt> is set to null.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Just before the first user thread is dispatched,
	      <tt>syscon_stream</tt> is nullified, and no further
	      output will be sent to it. This ensures that kernel
	      output will not interfere with user-mode use of the
	      console display. Once the first user-mode process is
	      started, it is the responsibility of the user-mode
	      logging agent to recover kernel logging messages from
	      the kernel message log buffer.
	    </p>
	    <h3>2.3. Use of Debugger Stream(<tt>dbg_stream</tt>)</h3>
	    <p>
	      If a debugger is present, it logically ``owns'' a stream
	      of its own -- the <tt>dbg_stream</tt>. If no debugger is
	      present, then <tt>dbg_stream</tt> is set to null. The
	      general idea is that the kernel debugger needs a
	      dedicated device to talk to the kernel with.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      To simplify the (human) debugger's view of what is going
	      on, all traffic to the <tt>syscon_stream</tt> is also
	      echoed to <tt>dbg_stream</tt> if one is present.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The previous generation of debugging logic had a pager
	      modeled after the UNIX <tt>more</tt> command. Because
	      <em>all</em> kernel output is now directed through the
	      same output logic, we have revised the output logic to
	      invoke the <em>more</em> interface only when the
	      debugger is active. This means that the <em>more</em>
	      prompt will appear only when output is occurring in
	      response to a debugger command.
	    </p>
	    <h3>2.4. Practical Complication</h3>
	    <p>
	      So long as <tt>dbg_stream</tt> and
	      <tt>syscon_stream</tt> are distinct (or null), the above
	      logic carries no contradictions. If the kernel debugger
	      is set up on the console, however, things get a bit
	      trickier. In this scenario, we know that the console
	      device has been dedicated for use by the debugger. Our
	      challenge is primarily to avoid the ``double vision''
	      that would ensue if both <tt>syscon_stream</tt> and
	      <tt>dbg_stream</tt> pointed to the same place.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The solution in this case is to <em>leave
	      <tt>syscon_stream</tt> set to null whenever
	      <tt>dbg_stream</tt> names the console</em>.  Because all
	      output sent to <tt>syscon_stream</tt> goes to
	      <tt>dbg_stream</tt> in any case, this does not cause
	      output to be lost.
