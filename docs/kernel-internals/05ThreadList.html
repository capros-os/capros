<p> A <strong>process</strong> is a domain that is currently occupied by a
thread.  Every thread has an associated domain, and every domain has
at most one associated thread.  Process management, then, is about
figuring out which threads are eligable to execute.
<p> In an ideal world, a computer will be running one thread on every
processor that the machine has.  This thread retains control until it
is no longer able to run.  Operating system designers are fond of
cloaking the issue in obscurity, but in the final analysis there are
only three reasons that a thread might be unable to run:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The thread is waiting it's turn to get access to some
       <em>exclusive</em> resource.  There may be many threads waiting
       for the same resource, and they will be set running access one
       at a time as the resource becomes available.  For example, a
       processor can only run one thread at a time.  If the processor
       is currently occupied, the next thread must wait until a
       processor becomes available.
       <p>
  <li> The thread is waiting for some <em>shared</em> resource to
       become available.  In EROS, the only shared resources are the
       primary objects: nodes and pages.  Many threads may be waiting
       for the same object to be brought into memory.  When it
       arrives, all of the waiting threads will be set running.
       <p>
  <li> The machine is turned off.  This book doesn't describe how to
       solve this problem, but we're pretty sure you can work it out
       for yourself.
</ul>
<p> Threads that are unable to run are said to be <strong>stalled</strong>.
<p> One way to think of an operating system is that it is the piece of
code that keeps track of all of the reasons why a thread cannot run,
and gets the thread running when it is possible to do so.  In this
view, everything in the operating system kernel exists for the purpose
of managing threads.  Our experience suggests that this is an
excellent way to think about the EROS kernel as well.  It's therefore
a good place to begin describing the EROS kernel.
<h1>1 What a Thread Is</h1>
<p> A <strong>thread</strong> is the schedulable unit of execution in the EROS
system.  Every thread occupies a domain, but the distinction between a
thread and the domain it occupies is an important one.  Threads, by
definition, are always running (though they may be stalled).  Domains
may be running, available, or waiting.  Informally, we will sometimes
speak of ``running domains,'' and about one domain ``calling''
another.  Strictly speaking, it is the thread that is running, and the
thread the executes the call operation.  This shorthand is very
useful, and we will undoubtedly fall prey to it in this book, but it
is essential when thinking about the kernel to keep the notions of
threads and domains separate.
<p> A thread carries three pieces of information:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> A <strong>priority</strong>, which indicates how important this thread is
       relative to other threads in the system.  Threads with higher
       priority are preferred over threads with lower priority.
       <p>
  <li> A <strong>protection domain</strong>, which captures the environment in
       which the thread executes.  Every thread has an associated
       domain.
       <p>
  <li> A <strong>queue slot</strong>, which is used to keep track of which queue
       a stalled thread is waiting on.
</ul>
<p> The thread class is shown in Figure 5.1..  Each
thread occupies a slot in the <strong>thread list</strong>.  The thread list is
saved every time the system takes a checkpoint, and is used as the
basis for starting the system when the system is first powered on.
<ul>
<pre>
struct ThreadLink {
  ThreadLink *next;
  ThreadLink *prev;
  void Unlink();
  ThreadLink()
    { next = prev = 0; }
};

struct Thread : public ThreadLink {
  // Thread priority is stored in the authority field of
  // the pseudo-key.
  Key domainKey;
  CachedDomain* pCachedDomain;

  void SleepOn(Queue&amp;);
  Thread();
  void Kill();
  bool Prepare();
  bool Unprepare();
private:
  friend class Queue;
  friend void ReSchedule();
  void Wakeup();
};
</pre>
<strong>Figure 5.1: The thread class</strong>
</ul>
<p> Threads are the only resource in the EROS system that is created
and destroyed.  When a thread performs a <em>fork</em> invocation, it
causes a new thread to be created.  When a thread performs a
<em>return</em> to most kernel keys, or when a domain key holder
forcibly places a domain in the <em>waiting</em> or <em>available</em>
states, the contained thread (if any) is destroyed.
<note> I'm
actually not at all happy with this model, and would prefer that
threads be conserved like everything else in the system, but this
seems to be the cleanest design we have arrived at to date.
</note>
<h1>2 Queues and Piles</h1>
<p> A thread can be in one of two states: <em>running</em> or
<em>stalled</em>.  A stalled thread is waiting for some resource to
become available.  Regrettably, threads spend most of their lives in
the stalled state.  Stalled threads are linked into the stall queue
associated with the required resource.  Every resource that might
become a source of blockage has an associated stall queue.
<p> EROS implements two kinds of stall queues.  An <strong>queue</strong> is
used to manage resources that can be used by only one thread at a
time.  Every domain has an associated queue, because only one thread
may occupy a domain at any given instant.  Threads that are placed on
a queue are woken up one at a time in order of their priority.  Each
thread queue maintains a doubly linked list of its queued threads, as
shown in Figure 5.2.
<note>
It may seem odd, at first,
that the queue insertion and removal procedures are not really
implemented in the queue class.  The relationship between queues and
threads is very close.  The insertion and removal operations could
have been implemented in either class, but implementing the wakeup
logic in the <code>QueueElement</code> class would require a virtual
function.  We wish to be able to copy the thread list easily when a
checkpoint operation occurs, and we don't want to have to reconstruct
any virtual table pointers to do so, so we implemented the insertion
and removal operators in the <code>Thread</code> class.  This sort of
confusion arises because the two classes really implement a single
abstraction.  It is one of the few places where the C++ implementation
must be taken into account.
</note>
<ul>
  <pre>
struct Queue : public ThreadLink {
  virtual void Wakeup()
  { ((Thread*)next)-&gt;Wakeup(); }

  Queue()
  : ThreadLink()
  { next = 0; prev = 0; }
};

struct Pile : public Queue {
  void Wakeup()
  {
    while(next)
       Queue::Wakeup();
  }
};
</pre>
  <strong>Figure 5.2: The queue classes</strong>
</ul>
<p> A <strong>pile</strong> is used to manage shared resources.  Threads that
are are waiting for a shared object to become available are placed on
the object's pile.  All threads in a pile are awakened simultaneously.
As you can see from the implementation in Figure 5.2, a
pile is merely a specialization of a queue.
<p> Because EROS is designed as a real-time system, EROS does not
implement any unordered queues.
<h2>2.1 Stalling a Thread</h2>
<p> Whenever a thread requires some resource that is unavailable, it
is inserted onto the queue associated with that resource.  In order to
allow threads to be removed from the queue easily, thread queues are
doubly linked.
<p> Threads in a queue are maintained in order of their priority.  The
highest priority thread always appears at the front of the queue.
Threads with lower priority appear later.  Threads with the same
priorities are listed in ``first come, first served'' order.  Later
arrivals are placed <em>behind</em> earlier arrivals. The
implementation is shown in Figure 5.3.
<ul>
  <pre>
void Thread::SleepOn(Queue&amp; q)
{
  ASSERT(next == 0);
  ASSERT(prev == 0);

  ThreadLink* ql = &amp;q;
  Thread *nextThread = (Thread) ql-&gt;next;

  while (nextThread &amp;&amp;
         nextThread-&gt;priority &gt;= priority){
    ql = (ThreadLink*) nextThread;
    nextThread = (Thread) ql-&gt;next;
  }

  // Either there are no more threads, or we should
  // be inserted after ql:

  next = ql-&gt;next;
  prev = ql;
  ql-&gt;next = this;
  if (next)
    next-&gt;prev = this;
}
  </pre>
  <strong>Figure 5.3: Putting a thread to sleep </strong>
</ul>
<h2>2.2 Waking a Thread Up</h2>
<p> The more interesting part of the mechanism is what happens when a
thread is removed from a resource queue because it is runnable.  You
might think that such a thread is placed on a processor, but it isn't
so.  Just because a thread is <em>prepared</em> to run doesn't
necessarily guarantee that it <em>deserves</em> to run.  There may be
higher priority threads that should be run first.
<p> Waking up a thread, then, doesn't really wake the thread up at
all.  It simply places the thread on another queue: the queue of
threads that are waiting for the next available processor!  The thread
wakeup routine is shown in Figure 5.4.
<ul>
  <pre>
void Thread::Wakeup()
{
  Unlink();
  SleepOn(ProcessorQueue);
  if (priority &gt; LowestRunningPriority)
    WantResched = true;
}
  </pre>
  <strong>Figure 5.4: Waking a thread up</strong>
</ul>
<h1>3 Setting a Thread In Motion</h1>
<p> Just because a thread exists doesn't mean we are able to set it
running!  Many constraints need to be met before we can load a thread
onto a processor and set it running.  The thread preparation routine
is shown in Figure 5.5. The first step is to <em>prepare</em> the
thread.
<ul>
  <pre>
void Thread::Prepare()
{
  ActiveThread = this;
  if (pCachedDomain)  // already prepared
    return;

  // force domain root into core
  if (domainKey.Prepare() == false) {
    // Domain root has been rescinded. Thread dies.
    // Nobody to notify.
    domainKey.Zero();
    // zap it
    SleepOn(FreeThreadList);
    goto lose;
  }

  // Preparing the domain may have started an I/O
  // rather than succeeding immediately.
  if (!domainKey.Prepared)
    goto lose;

  // Attempt to prepare the domain root node
  // as a domain:
  domainKey.pObject-&gt;PrepAs(NtDomain);
  if (next)
    goto lose;

  pCachedDomain = domainKey.pObject-&gt;CacheDomain();
  pCachedDomain-&gt;SetThread(this);
  return;

lose:
  ActiveThread = 0;
  return;
}
  </pre>
  <strong>Figure 5.5: Preparing a thread</strong>
</ul>
<p> The idea of ``preparing'' an object will appear again and again in
the EROS kernel.  In a nutshell, the fact that an object is prepared
tells us that various constraints are satisfied.  Once prepared,
objects tend to stay prepared until circumstances force us to
deprepare them.  A thread, for example, will stay prepared across
timeslices, which allows us to efficiently verify that it is able to
be run.  Domains and segments are also prepared in this fashion.
<h2>3.3 Preparing the Thread to Run</h2>
<p> If the thread has been waiting for a long time, or the system has
just been restarted, it is altogether likely that the thread's domain
will not be in memory.  Preparing a thread causes it's associated
domain to be loaded into memory and prepared for execution.  If the
domain associated with a prepared thread is ever removed from memory,
the thread is <em>deprepared</em>.
<p> An unprepared thread contains the object identifier (OID) of the
domain that it occupies.  If the thread is unprepared, the <code>prepared</code> field will be <code>false</code>. The domain occupied by an
unprepared thread may or may not be in memory.  If it <em>is</em> in
memory, it may or may not be ready to run.
<p> The only time that we attempt to prepare a thread is when we are
getting set to run that thread, so the first step is to remove the
thread from the <code>ProcessorQueue</code> on the assumption that we
are about to hand it a processor.  If any of the following steps
should fail, we will discover that the thread has ended up back on a
sleep queue.
<p> For the sake of completeness, we should say here that unpreparing
a thread simply means forgetting the association between the thread
and the domain cache entry.  The key is not deprepared.
<h3>3.3.1 Locating the Domain Root</h3>
<p> The first step is to locate the domain that the thread occupies by
preparing the <code>domainKey</code>.  Preparing a key either locates
the domain root node in memory or initiates an I/O operation and
places the thread in the pile associated with that I/O operation.  If
the domain key is successfully prepared, we know that the domain root
is in memory and the <code>domainKey</code> contains a pointer to it.
If the thread is now asleep, we stop -- the thread will be awakened
when the I/O completes and we will start over again.
<p> Preparing a key can have three outcomes:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The prepare can succeed, in which case the object is in memory
       and the prepared key contains a pointer to it.  In this case,
       the <code>Prepared</code> bit of the key will be set.
       <p>
  <li> The prepare can cause an I/O, in which case the thread is
       placed on an I/O wait queue, and the <code>Prepared</code> bit
       of the key will not be set.
       <p>
  <li> The prepare can fail because the domain has been rescinded.  In
       this case <code>Key::Prepare()</code> returns
       <code>false</code>.
</ul>
<p> Assuming the domain root is found, it is possible that the thread
is occupying an obsolete version of the object.  This is discovered by
checking the object's allocation count to make sure that the thread is
still valid.  If the domain root is obsolete, the thread has died, and
pushd is placed on the available thread list.
<h3>3.3.2 Preparing the Domain</h3>
<p> Once we have found a valid domain root, the next step is to make
sure that the domain is ready to be used.  If it hasn't been already,
the domain must be prepared.
<p> The details of preparing a domain are the subject of the next
chapter, so we will only outline the process here.  The three nodes
associated with the domain must be found in memory.  Some validity
checks are made on the domain to ensure that it is well formed.  When
it is all over, the process of preparing the domain has three possible
outcomes:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The domain will be successfully prepared, in which case the
       thread can be run.
       <p>
  <li> Some I/O operation was necessary in order to prepare the
       domain; the thread has been put to sleep waiting for the
       operation to happen.
       <p>
  <li> The domain is not well formed, in which case the prepare
       operation will fail.  <em>What to do in this case presents an
       interesting challenge.</em>
</ul>
<p> If all goes well, a side effect of preparing the domain is that
the domain's address space segment will also be prepared.
<p> If the domain is <em>not</em> well formed, the thread
<p> After attempting to prepare the domain, it is once again possible
that the thread has been placed on a pile to wait for some object to
appear.  If an object necessary to run the thread was not in memory,
it will be fetched as a side effect of attempting to prepare the
domain.
<h3>3.3.3 Loading the Domain Cache</h3>
<p> Once a domain is prepared, we have all of the information needed
to begin execution.  Unfortunately, the format of a domain does not
lend itself to efficient context switching.  To deal with this, we
first load the domain's state into the domain cache, which is layed
out to allow us to efficiently start up the domain.  If a domain is
prepared, it can be loaded into the domain cache without further I/O
delays.  The relationship between a domain and it's cache entry is
shown in Figure 5.6.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- CachedDomain.eps -->
  <p> Figure 5.6: A cached domain
</ul>
<p> Once the domain has been loaded into the domain cache, we store a
pointer to the domain cache entry within the thread, and mark the
thread prepared.  After it's all over, the relationship between a
prepared thread, it's domain cache entry, and the domain itself are
shown in Figure 5.7.  The pointer from the thread to
the domain is held in the prepared DomainKey.
<ul>

  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- PreppedThread.eps -->
  <p> Figure 5.7: A prepared thread
</ul>
<h2>3.4 Performing A Context Switch</h2>
<p> Finally, we now have a prepared thread.  Since the thread is
prepared, we are able to context switch into its domain and set it
running.  In a nutshell, this is done by loading the register set from
the current thread's domain cache.  Domain preparation and the domain
cache are the subjects of the next two chapters.
<h1>4 Migrating Threads</h1>
<p> <!-- FIX: This section properly belongs in the chapter on message
passing, which doesn't exist yet. -->
<p> One of the operations that a thread can perform while running in a
domain is to <em>call</em> another domain.  EROS implements a
so-called <strong>migrating threads</strong> model, which means that when a
thread performs a <em>call</em> or <em>return</em>, it moves from one
domain to the other.
<p> Suppose a thread in domain <EM>A</EM> performs a call on a key to domain
<EM>B</EM>.  Prior to the call, the thread occupies domain <EM>A</EM>, as shown in
Figure 5.8.  Domain <EM>A</EM> is
<em>running</em>, and domain <EM>B</EM> is <em>available</em>.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ThreadMigratePreCall.eps -->
  <p> Figure 5.8: Thread location before a call
</ul>
<p> Once the call operation has happened, the thread migrates into
domain <EM>B</EM> (Figure 5.9).  The
<code>domainKey</code> and <code>pCachedDomain</code> fields of the
thread are updated to point to the new domain.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ThreadMigratePostCall.eps -->
  <p> Figure 5.8: Thread location after a call
</ul>
Domain <EM>A</EM>
is left in the <em>waiting</em> state, and domain <EM>B</EM> is now
<em>running</em>.  A return key has been fabricated by the kernel so
that the thread can return to the original domain.
<p> Eventually, the thread performs a <em>return</em> operation
(Figure~5.9).  Domain <EM>B</EM> is once again left
<em>available</em>, and domain <EM>B</EM> is once again <em>running</em>.
The return key is consumed by the return operation.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ThreadMigratePostRet.eps -->
  <p> Figure 5.9: Thread location after returning
</ul>
<p> The details of message passing will be explored in detail in a
later chapter.  For now, the important point is that threads are
rarely created or destroyed, and that the thread identity remains the
same throughout.  Since the priority moves with the thread, the thread
in the new domain runs at the priority of the user.
