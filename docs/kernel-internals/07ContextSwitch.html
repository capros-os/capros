<p> Having described the domain structure and the domain cache
structure, we can now turn our attention to context switching.  While
our description is given with regard to the i486 architecture, the
basic approach described here is suitable for almost any
microprocessor.
<h1>1 The Active Thread</h1>
<p> At any given instant, there is exactly at most one active thread
in the system per processor.  If no other threads are runnable, the
kernel executes an idle loop until one is ready to run.  The currently
active thread is identified by the <code>ActiveThread</code> pointer,
which points to an entry in the thread table.
[<a href="#fn7-1">note</a>]
<p> The context
of an active thread is cached in the domain cache, and cannot be
decached without forcing the thread to be descheduled.
<p> When a thread is in the kernel, the kernel keeps track of two
thread pointers.  The <code>ActiveThread</code> pointer identifies the
thread that is currently running in the kernel.  The
<code>NextThread</code> pointer identifies the thread that we will be
returning to.
<p> Unless the active thread stalls or performs a message send, the
normal expectation when a thread enters the kernel is that control
will return to the process that invoked the kernel.  When a thread
enters the kernel, <code>NextThread</code> is therefore initially set
to the value of <code>ActiveThread</code>.
<p> The active thread can become deactivated (thereby losing the
processor) for one of three reasons.  In order of increasing
frequency, these are:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The thread is destroyed by the destruction of its containing
       domain.
       <p>
  <li> The scheduling quanta timer goes off, forcing a the scheduler
       to be invoked.
       <p>
  <li> The thread invokes a key that causes it to become stalled.
</ul>
<p> In any of these cases, <code>NextThread</code> is set to zero, and
the scheduler is invoked before exiting the kernel.
<h2>1.1 Stalling the Active Thread</h2>
<p> Conceptually, a key invocation either completes successfully or
stalls just before the invocation actually occurs.  The EROS kernel is
careful to maintain this constraint, because only a very limited
amount of per-process state can safely be preserved within the kernel.
<p> In practice, of course, the key invocation proceeds into the
kernel checking various conditions, and either makes it all the way to
completion or discovers that some requirement cannot be met.  As an
example, consider the algorithm for preparing a key, which is outlined
in Figure 7.1.  All of the paths that involve
bringing the object into memory cause the requesting process to go to
sleep.
<ul>
  <em>
  <pre>
if (key is prepared)
  validate memory allocation count
  return success

object = search hashtable for (key.oid,key.obType)
if (object)
  prepare key
  return success

bring object into memory somehow
  </pre>
  </em>
  <p> <strong>Figure 7.1: Preparing a key</strong>
</ul>
\begin{figure}[htb] \begin{center} \leavevmode
 \end{center} \caption{Preparing a key} <a
name="fig:KeyPrepAlgorithm"> \end{figure}
<p> If the object needs to be brought in to memory, the thread will
end up invoking <code>Thread::SleepOn()</code> and then calling
<code>Resched()</code> (see below).
<h1>2 Invoking the Scheduler</h1>
<p> While running in the kernel, any thread can voluntarily relinquish
the processor by calling <code>Resched()</code>.  Conceptually, it
would always be correct to call <code>Resched()</code> from within the
<code>Thread::SleepOn()</code> routine. It is occasionally useful to allow
the thread to continue performing kernel operations before
relinquishing the processor, so the two calls are performed
separately.  It is expected that a thread in the kernel will call
<code>Resched()</code> shortly after performing any action that puts
it to sleep.  <em>It is an error</em> if the kernel code manages to
return to user level with the active thread asleep.
<p> To detect this possibility, <code>Thread::SleepOn()</code> sets
the <code>NextThread</code> pointer to 0 when the active thread places itself
on a sleep queue.  Eventually, the thread will make it's way back up
the stack to the point at which it entered the kernel, where the value
of <code>ActiveThread</code> will be tested and the scheduler will be
invoked to determine who should run next.
<p> While it is not visible from the code, calls to
<code>Resched()</code> do not return.  A thread that calls
<code>Resched()</code> is taking the final step in voluntarily
relinquishing the processor.  <code>Resched()</code> performs the
following actions:
<p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li> It releases any locks that the thread may hold in the kernel.
       <p>
  <li> It identifies the thread that should be run next, changes the
       value of <code>ActiveThread</code> and <code>NextThread</code>
       to point to this thread.  and attempts to prepare the thread.
       <p>
  <li> If <code>NextThread</code> is now zero (which means the prepare
       failed), return to step 2.
       <p>
  <li> If performs a <code>longjump</code> directly to the place in
       the kernel just before where it returns to the new thread.
</ol>
<p> Following this, the kernel simply returns to the current thread,
which has just been altered by <code>Resched()</code>.

<p> 
This approach
will need to change in the multiprocessor implementation.
