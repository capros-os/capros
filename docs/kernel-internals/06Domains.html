<p> This chapter describes the EROS domain mechanism.  A domain
provides the environment in which a thread executes.  It defines the
program that the thread interprets, the current state of the
execution, and the authorities that the program can reference.
<h1>1 Structure of a Domain</h1>
<p> A domain is composed of three nodes: the domain root, the general
registers node, and the general keys node, as shown in
Figure 6.1.  The general keys node defines the 16
capabilities that are held by the domain.  The general registers node
stores the register values of the domain.  The domain root identifies
the domain's address space segment, keeper, and schedule authorities.
In addition, any registers that would not fit in the general registers
node overflow into the domain root.

</ul>
<p> While most of these fields have already been described, three of
them have not been mentioned before: the brand, the trap code, and the
message buffer key.  The message buffer key will be addressed in the
chapter on message passing.
<h2>1.1 The Trap Code</h2>
<p> Occasionally, a thread will encounter an exceptional condition
while interpreting the program of a domain.  Typically, these will be
related to instructions:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> Executing an illegal opcode,
       <p>
  <li> Executing an undefined opcode,
       <p>
  <li> Performing an operation with a range error, such as a divide by
       zero,
       <p>
  <li> Executing a trap instruction,
       <p>
  <li> Accessing an address that falls outside the range defined by
       the address space segment.
       <p>
  <li> Performing a system call trap in a domain marked for emulation.
</ul>
<p> Alternatively, the exception may reflect the discovery that the
domain is not well-formed.  For example, it may lack a proper address
space segment.  The definition of a well-formed domain is discussed
below.
<p> When an attempt to execute a thread within a domain leads to one
of these conditions, the EROS kernel places a value in the <strong>trap
code slot</strong> indicating the nature of the exception.  It then invokes
the domain's keeper, passing it a message that appears to have been
sent by the domain itself.  The message includes a <strong>domain key</strong>
to the domain and a resume key with which the domain can be restarted.
The domain keeper is expected to either fix the problem and resume the
domain or take some other corrective action.
<h2>1.2 Brands and the Domain Tool</h2>
<p> One of the crucial elements of effective security is
<strong>discretion</strong>.  A discrete service is one that is provably unable
to give your data to any third party, because it has no way of
transmitting information unless you give it one.
<p> The brand key provides both a way to verify discretion and a way
to verify the identity of a service.  Just because a domain
<em>claims</em> to be the genuine mumblefratz service doesn't mean
that it is, and a user might be justifiably concerned about handing
their data to some random service that might steal it.  After all,
there's no telling where that domain has been...
<h3>1.2.1 Escrow Agents</h3>
<p> In EROS, every trusted service has an associated escrow agent.  To
construct a domain that performs the mumblefratz service, you go to
the mumblefratz escrow agent and ask it to build one for you.  The
escrow agent code is a trusted system component.  The mumblefratz
escrow agent contains this code, plus a ``template'' that describes
how to build mumblefratz service domains.  Every escrow agent stamps
each of its product domains with a unique key (typically a start key
to the escrow agent) that identifies the builder of the domain.
<p> Now suppose you have a program that holds a key to a domain that
alleges to provide the trusted mumblefratz service.  If you can manage
to find the mumblefratz escrow agent, you can ask it if the key really
names a mumblefratz service domain.  The remaining problem, then, is
to make sure that you have your hands on the genuine mumblefratz
escrow agent.
<p> Escrow agents themselves are program instances, and are created by
the escrow agent agent, which is a system-provided service.  Given a
key to a domain that alleges to be the mumblefratz escrow agent, you
can ask the escrow agent agent to validate that the mumblefratz escrow
agent is really an escrow agent.  If it is, you know that it will not
lie about the mumblefratz service's identity.
<p> Once you know that the mumblefratz escrow agent is a genuine
escrow agent, you can ask the escrow agent if it's products are
discreet.  By careful construction, the escrow agent is able to tell
you.
<h3>1.2.2 Protecting the Brand</h3>
<p> One small issue remains that needs to be addressed for the brand
key to be believed.  A domain is simply a node, and since the user who
constructs the domain supplies that node it is possible that they will
retain a node key to the node.  If they hold a node key, they are in a
position to alter the brand of the domain.
<p> The domain tool is the mechanism that creates domains out of
nodes.  If you hand a domain tool a node and a brand key, the domain
tool returns a <strong>domain service key</strong> to the same node.  As long as
the creator of the domain does not hand out any node keys, the brand
cannot be altered.  In practice, the <code>domain creator</code> is
the only holder of the domain tool.  Since the domain creator is
trusted code, the brand is effectively unforgeable.
<h1>2 Getting a Domain Ready to Run</h1>
<p> In order for a thread to execute within a domain, the domain must
be properly formed.  This is verified by <em>preparing</em> the
domain.  Once prepared, the domain's associated information can be
loaded into the domain cache so that context switching can be
performed efficiently.
<h2>2.3 Well-Formed Domains</h2>
<p> To be well-formed, a domain must meet two constraints:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> It must have a valid read-write node key in slot 15.
       <p>
  <li> It must have a valid read-write node key in slot 14, and all of
       the keys in the corresponding node must be number keys.
</ul>
<p> You might expect that a well-formed domain would have some other
requirements as well:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> It might require a valid schedule key.
       <p>
  <li> It might require a start key to a keeper.
       <p>
  <li> It might require a page or segment key in the address space
       slot.
</ul>
<p> A well-formed domain need not have a valid schedule key.  A domain
that lacks a schedule key may be in the <em>running</em> state, and
may contain a thread, but it will never receive any CPU cycles.  It is
a common practice for debuggers to take advantage of this fact by
inserting a zero number key into the schedule slot when they wish to
halt a domain.
<p> A well-formed domain need not have a valid start key to a keeper.
If a program that lacks a keeper key encounters an exception, it
simply stops without telling anyone.  The trap code is set to indicate
the nature of the failure, and the domain is placed on a special queue
of ``broken'' domains.  Threads within these domains remain running
but unable to execute instructions.
<p> A well-formed domain need not have a valid address space.  When
such a domain goes to execute it's first instruction, it will take an
address fault.
<h2>2.4 Preparing the Domain</h2>
<p> When a thread attempts to execute within a domain, the domain must
first be <em>prepared</em>.  Preparing a domain verifies that the
domain is well-formed, and ensures that any operation on the member
nodes which would violate the domain contract will be detected.  The
domain preparation algorithm is shown in Figure 6.2.
<ul>
  <pre>
CachedDomain*
Node::PrepareAsDomain()
{
  // if already prepared, we're done:
  if (obPrepType == NtDomainRoot)
    return cacheEntry ? cacheEntry : CacheDomain();
  
  Unprepare();

  // Prepare the key to the general regs node
  // to ensure that node is in core:

  if (!slot[14].Prepare(KtNode))
    return 0;

  // Ditto for the key to the general keys node
  if (!slot[15].Prepare(KtNode))
    return 0;

  if (!slot[14].Prepared || !slot[15].Prepared)
    Resched();

  Node&amp; genRegs = *((Node *) slot[14].pObject);
  Node&amp; genKeys = *((Node *) slot[15].pObject);

  if (genKeys.obPrepType != NtGenKeys || genKeys.domainRoot != this) {
    genKeys.Unprepare();
    genKeys.obPrepType = NtGenKeys;
    genKeys.domainRoot = this;
  }

  if (genKeys.obPrepType != NtGenRegs || genKeys.domainRoot != this) {
    genRegs.Unprepare();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++)
      if (genRegs[i].keyType != KtNumber)
        return 0;

    genRegs.obPrepType = NtGenRegs;
    genRegs.domainRoot = this;
  }

  // We're done!
  obPrepType = NtDomainRoot;
  return CacheDomain();
}
  </pre>
  <strong>Figure 6.2: Preparing a domain</strong>
</ul>
<p> In spite of the fact that this
algorithm looks simple, there are a number of hidden assumptions
buried in it, so let's go through it step by step.
<h3>2.4.3 Validating the Domain Root</h3>
<p> The first curiosity is the call to <code>Unprepare()</code>.
While the only holder of the domain tool is the domain creator, the
<em>kernel</em> does not assume that it can depend on the correctness
of the domain creator.  It is therefore possible that the domain root
node has been used in some other context, and therefore needs to be
unprepared to invalidate any cached state.
<p> It is also possible for any of the three nodes to be completely
unprepared, in which case the node will show <code>NtNode</code> as
its <code>obPrepType</code>.  This occurs when the node is first brought in
to memory, and again as the node reaches the age where we are
preparing to discard it.  Under these conditions, the kernel
deprepares these nodes to ensure that outstanding pointers to them
will be properly invalidated.
<h3>2.4.4 Preparing the Keys</h3>
<p> The next step is to prepare the keys to the general registers and
general keys node.  This forces the respective nodes to be brought
into memory if necessary, and places pointers to them in the
respective keys.  If either prepare fails, the key is invalid, and the
domain cannot be prepared.  The domain is now permanently broken, and
any contained thread is lost.
<h3>2.4.5 Preparing the Subsidiary Nodes</h3>
<p> As with the domain root, the general keys node and general
registers node may currently be interpreted as some other sort of
node.  Perversely, they might be interpreted as you would expect but
in the context of some other domain.  In either case they must be
unprepared before we prepare them for use in this domain.
<p> For the same reason, it is possible that the content of the
general registers node is something other than number keys.  In this
case the domain is broken, and preparation fails.
<h3>2.4.6 A Design Choice</h3>
<p> An interesting design question for <code>PrepareAsDomain()</code>
is whether it should cache the domain automatically or simply perform
the prepare step.  In turn, this depends on which copy of the domain
state we expect to operate on more frequently - the cached copy or the
copy in the domain root.  In one design, we would favor the domain
root and decache the domain whenever we wanted to perform an operation
on it.  In this design, <code>PrepareAsDomain()</code> should not
cache the domain -- we will in fact have to <em>decache</em> it before
the entries in the domain root and subsidiary domains can be believed.
<p> In the other design, we would favor cacheing the domain in order
to perform our operations.  A little thought reveals why this design
is to be preferred.
<p> The most common case of operations on a domain arise from
recoverable segment faults.  The domain performs an access to a copy
on write segment or to a page that it hasn't mapped into it's mapping
tables yet.  Such a domain can be expected to run again soon, so it is
preferable not to decache it.
<h1>3 The Domain Cache</h1>
<p> The domain structure conveniently places all state in nodes, which
greatly simplifies the checkpoint logic.  While this choice of layout
makes sense for squeezing the registers into number keys, it isn't
exactly an efficient layout for a real processor.  Among other things,
the registers are saved in two different nodes that may not be
anywhere near each other in memory.  Enter the domain cache.
<p> The purpose of the domain cache is to provide a register layout
that can be efficiently loaded and stored by the processor during a
context switch.  Loading the domain cache is simply a matter of
copying the appropriate register values into the domain cache entry
and marking the domain root as cached.  Information that has been
placed in the domain cache will be moved back to the domain on demand.
<p> The easiest way to understand why the domain cache is necessary is
to look at a real example: the Intel 486.
<h2>3.5 Entering the Kernel on the i486</h2>
<p> The i486 implements 4 privilege levels.  Processes move inwards
across these privilege levels under hardware control, which allows
protection to be enforced.  Each privilege level has its own dedicated
stack.
<p> There are three mechanisms for crossing a privilege boundary:
conventional interrupts (or traps), the virtual 8086 interrupt
mechanism, and the call gate mechanism.  Each places different
information on the inner stack, and each needs to be handled by the
EROS kernel.  Further, the behavior of the conventional interrupt
mechanism depends on the privilege level that was active when the
interrupt occurred.
<p> To simplify things a bit, the EROS kernel makes use of only two
privilege levels.  Ring 3 (the least privileged) is used for domain
code, and ring 0 for the kernel itself.  All interrupts and call gates
are directed to ring 0.  In effect, we simply pretend that the
processor implements only two privilege levels.
<h3>3.5.7 Conventional Interrupts</h3>
<p> When a conventional (protected mode) 486 task takes an interrupt,
the processor loads a new program counter from the interrupt
descriptor entry, and a new stack pointer from the hardware-defined
task descriptor table.  Once it has loaded the new stack pointer, it
creates the stack image shown in Figure 6.3.
The error code is not pushed in all cases, so a zero error code must
sometimes be added by the interrupt handler code.
[<a href="#fn6-1">note</a>]

  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- OuterIntStack486.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.3: 486 outer ring interrupt stack
</ul>
<p> When an interrupt occurs while running ring 0 (kernel) code, no
privilege level change occurs.  The old flags and instruction pointer
are simply pushed onto the existing stack, as shown in Figure 6.4.  A
zero error code is sometimes supplied by software.
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- InnerIntStack486.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.4: 486 inner ring interrupt stack
</ul>
<h3>3.5.8 Virtual 8086 Interrupts</h3>
<p> One of the operating modes of the i486 is the so-called ``virtual
8086'' mode.  In this mode, the machine executes in a way that is
mostly compatible with old 16 bit code.  Virtual 8086 tasks are, by
definition, tasks in ring 3, so entering the kernel requires a
privilege change.  Because the segment registers of the 8086 are
interpreted according to completely different rules from those of the
protected mode i486, they must be saved specially by the interrupt
logic.  The resulting stack image is shown in
Figure 6.5.  The problem is those pesky segment
registers, as we will see in a moment.  
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- V86IntStack486.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.5: Virtual 8086 interrupt stack
</ul>
<h3>3.5.9 Call Gates</h3>
<p> The call gate mechanism leaves the stack looking very much like
the conventional interrupt mechanism.  The resulting stack is shown in
Figure 6.6.  The number of parameters is
controlled by the call gate descriptor, and can be up to 31
doublewords.  
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- CallGateStack486.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.6: 486 Call gate stack
</ul>
In practice, EROS does not accept any arguments through the call gate,
so the call gate stack is nearly identical to the conventional
interrupt stack.  So much so that the EROS kernel actually pushes a
zero error code to make the stack structure look like the previous
cases.
<p> A slight sticking point is that the kernel must remember if the
entry was due to a call or an interrupt so that the proper return
instruction -- RET or IRET -- can be used.
<p> EROS uses the call gate mechanism rather than the interrupt
mechanism as the basic mechanism for domains that wish to invoke a
kernel service.  There are several reasons for this:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> The call gate mechanism is slightly faster than the interrupt
       mechanism, particularly on older processors.
       Table 6.1 shows the cycle counts when
       everything hits in the cache.  Cache misses have roughly
       equivalent impacts on both mechanisms.

  <li> Virtual 8086 tasks have no way to perform a call gate
       instruction, which allows the kernel to assume that the layout

  <li> The option to pass arguments to kernel calls may later prove
       useful.
</ul>
<h2>3.6 The Domain Cache Structure</h2>
<p> Context switching performance is critical in the EROS
architecture.  One of the tricks to doing it quickly is to avoid
unnecessary copying of registers during the context switch path.  We
do this by making the stack pointer point directly to the area where
the registers will ultimately be saved, so the structure of the domain
cache entry follows closely from the exception stack frame.  The i486
domain cache structure is illustrated in
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- DomainCache486.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.7: 486 domain cache layout
</ul>
<p> At first glance, it might appear that the different stack layout
used by a Virtual 8086 mode interrupt would present a problem.  In
practice it does not.  The only way for a task to enter Virtual 8086
mode is by performing a kernel call.  As a result, the kernel always
knows what sort of domain it is running, and can contrive to set the
save area stack pointer to the proper place.
<p> When a task first enters the kernel, it writes its register set to
the kernel stack, which in practice always points to the domain cache
entry.  Once the registers have been saved, the stack pointer is
adjusted to point to a proper kernel stack.  When the kernel itself
takes a further interrupt, execution proceeds undisturbed on the
kernel stack.
<p> The trailing fields in the domain cache entry structure are as
follows:

<h1>4 Keys Related to Domains</h1>
<p> There are four kinds of keys that are associated with domains: the
start key, the return key, the domain key, and the domain service key.
All domain keys except the return key share the same basic structure,
which is shown in Figure 6.8.  
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- DomainKey.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.8: Domain key structure
</ul>
<p> The details of the key fields are deferred to
<a href="20ObjectCache.html">Chapter 20</a>.
<h2>4.7 Start and Return Keys</h2>
<p> A start key conveys the authority to invoke the program contained
in a domain.  Anyone who holds a start key can send a message to the
domain that it names.  The message can include up to one page of data
and up to four keys.
<p> Every start key contains within it's <em>authority</em> field a
<strong>data byte</strong>.  When the start key is invoked, this byte is
automatically passed to the receiving domain.  The data byte allows
the domain to provide different services to different callers.  For
example, the escrow agent uses the data byte to distinguish between
the party installing items in the escrow and the party removing items
from the escrow.
<p> The return key has a different form than the start key, as shown
in Figure 6.9.  
<ul>
  <p> <img src="../img/construction.gif"><em>Pardon us while we figure
  out what to do about figures in HTML</em>
  <!-- ReturnKey.eps -->
  <p> Figure 6.9: Return key structure
</ul>
<p> Once again, the details of the key fields are deferred to
<a href="20ObjectCache.html">Chapter 20</a>.  The authority field contains a data
byte matching the data byte of the originally invoked key.  The call
count is used to ensure that there is at most one return for every
call.
<h2>4.8 Domain Keys</h2>
<p> When a domain is created by the domain tool, a <strong>domain key</strong>
is returned to the domain creator, which in turn hands it back to the
client who constructed the domain.  The domain key conveys essentially
complete authority over a domain.  It conveys the authority to alter
every slot of the domain root except the brand.  In addition, it can
alter the contents of the general registers node and the general keys
nodes, enabling it to change the values of registers and authorities.
<p> From a practical perspective, the most important service performed
by the domain key is the creation of start keys.  One of the
operations that can be performed using the domain key is to create a
start key with a specified data byte.  The start key can then be
handed out to whoever should hold it.
<h2>4.9 Domain Service Keys</h2>
<p> The <strong>domain service key</strong> is a weaker version of the domain
key.  Like start keys, a domain service key can be constructed using
the domain key.  The domain service key conveys the authority to read
and write the schedule and address segment key slots, and the trap
code slot.  In addition, and most importantly, the domain service key
has an operation that allows the keeper to resume a faulted domain.
<p> The most common use of a domain service key occurs when a domain
takes an execution fault.  When this happens, the kernel fabricates a
domain service key and passes it, along with the fault information, to
the faulting domain's keeper.  From the keeper's perspective, it
appears that the faulted domain has <em>called</em> the keeper.
Typically, the keeper returns via the domain service key rather than
the resume key, restarting the domain.
[<a href="#fn6-2">note</a>]
<p>
<H1>Notes</H1>
<fn id=fn6-1>
<p>
A better
interrupt design would have unconditionally placed an error code on
the stack, pushing some well defined value (such as zero) when no
error code was needed.  In addition, it would place the exception
number on the stack.  The i486 design requires that this be corrected
by software, at the cost of nearly an additional kilobyte of code.  In
most operating systems this would be unnoticable.  In EROS, it
represents 2% code size overhead!  Newer Intel processors, including
the Pentium and the P6, implement a proprietary interrupt mechanism
that is considerably more efficient.
</fn>
<fn id=fn6-2>
<p> I'm not altogether
happy with this design.  It feels to me like this situation should
somehow generate a distinguished return key of some sort, so that the
domain keeper logic could look like the logic of everything else.
This distinguished key might, for lack of a better term, be called the
<em>resume key</em>.  The problem with simply using a conventional
return key is that the returned arguments will mess up the state of
the faulted domain, which doesn't really know that it is effectively
in the <em>waiting</em> state.
