<h1>1 The Ten Commandments of EROS</h1>
<p> The EROS kernel design has been guided by a small number of
architectural rules.  These rules are chosen to ensure that the kernel
is reliable and recoverable, and have the force of law in the design
of the kernel:
<p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Thou Shalt Not Deadlock</em>.  No kernel code will be
       implemented in such a way as to create an unresolvable conflict
       of resources.
       <p> The justification for this is distressingly obvious:
       systems that get into unresolvable resource conflicts are not,
       by definition, reliable.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Thou Shalt Not Retain State</em>. No user state is retained
       in the kernel for longer than the invocation of a key.  Drivers
       that keep state in the kernel must be prepared to reconstruct
       this state when the system is restarted.
       <p> The more non-recoverable state the kernel maintains, the
       more complicated it is to implement persistence and recovery.
       In addition, this rule serves to enforce a minimalist
       philosophy.  The EROS kernel contains only two tables that must
       be saved across system shutdowns: the process list and the
       checkpoint log directory.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Kernel invocations shall be satisfied in bounded time</em>.
       Regardless of any other operations in progress, any kernel
       operation requested by a running process must complete
       successfully within a bounded amount of time.  For example, a
       disk read must have bounded delay.
       <p> Sometimes the hardware does not permit this.  An example is
       network packet delivery.  Broadcast networks do not guarantee
       bounded delivery time, so the kernel cannot provide such a
       guarantee to the user.
       <p> Note that since the process scheduler is not invoked
       explicitly, this rule does not apply to it.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Thou Shalt Not Perform Dynamic Allocation</em>. A common
       practice in kernel design is to have a fixed pool of resources
       that is dynamically allocated by many tasks.  Typically, this
       is done because the resource is precious and there isn't enough
       of it to go around.  For example, kernel memory is often
       allocated and deallocated in this way even though there is a
       fixed amount of it.
       <p> The problem with this approach is that you can temporarily
       run out of the dynamically allocated resource.  When you run
       out, one of two things happens:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <p>
	 <li> The system deadlocks, which we have already decided is
	      unacceptable,
	      <p>
	 <li> The second requestor is deferred. This leads to
	      unpredictable starvation, which is not acceptable in a
	      real-time kernel.  It also requires that the kernel
	      implement recovery mechanisms.
       </ul>
       <p> For these reasons, dynamic resource allocation is
       prohibited in the EROS kernel.  A few internal algorithms
       temporarily allocate a small number of pages of storage out of
       the general pool, but the total number of pages that might be
       allocated in this way at one time is bounded and small.
       Conceptually, these pages are statically allocated, but are
       made available for cacheing use when not needed by the
       algorithms they support.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Thou Shalt Not Abstract</em>. Where doing so does not
       violate security, the kernel should fully expose the underlying
       hardware to applications through suitable capabilities.
       <p> The notable exception to this rule is the decision that the
       kernel owns the disk and provides a single level store.  This
       is a case where the demands of security and reliability were
       deemed to outweigh the perils of abstraction.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Resources Shall Be Conserved</em>.  System resources are
       neither created nor destroyed.  The kernel does not permit any
       kernel-managed resource to be overallocated.  This is necessary
       to prevent deadlock, and removes the need for complex recovery
       algorithms in the kernel.
       <p> A corollary to resource conservation is that the kernel
       does not allocate resources on behalf of a user program.  Any
       operation that requires the provision of a page or node is
       reflected to an appropriate user-level agent.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Thou Shalt Not Allocate Resources</em>.  The EROS kernel
       arbitrates access to pages and nodes, and provides primitive
       facilities to allow programs to rescind such access, but it
       does reallocate these resources unless directed to do so by
       user-level code.
       <p> A notable (and disagreeable) exception to this is process
       scheduling.  User programs are responsible for assigning
       program priorities, but the kernel determines the order in
       which programs will run and how much time each will be given.
       We have been unable to come up with a user-level scheduling
       module that satisfies our real-time constraints, and have
       reluctantly moved the implementation of scheduling policy into
       the kernel.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Recovery Strategies Should Be Simple</em>.  The kernel
       should never run complex algorithms when it is under pressure
       to do something quickly.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Eight commandments is enough</em>.
</ol>
<p> In a nutshell, the kernel is not designed to be the solution to
all problems in the system.  Rather, it is designed to let user-level
code handle most of the policy decisions in a structured, secure way.
<p> In addition to the iron-clad rules, there are some guidelines that
are nearly as strong, but require some interpretation:
<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li> <em>Policy should be minimized</em>.  Constructing a secure
       system demands that the kernel implement some collection of
       fundamental policies. In EROS, these policies are designed to
       facilitate the construction of higher-level policies in user
       code.
       <p>
  <li> <em>Exception handling should be implemented in user level
       code</em>.  This is really a corollary to the minimal policy
       guideline.  Wherever the kernel handles exceptions on its own,
       it deprives user level code of the ability to implement a
       variety of policies.
</ul>
<h1>2 Policy Minimization</h1>
<p> One of the design goals of the EROS system is to minimize the
complexity of the policies that are implemented by the kernel.
Wherever it is possible to do so, the kernel provides a simple,
primitive policy that can be used by programs to implement more
complex policies.  This simultaneously reduces the complexity of the
kernel and increases the flexibility of the system.
<p> As an example, let's look at the handling of the stack in UNIX and
EROS.  As a UNIX process performs procedure calls, it's stack slowly
grows. At some point the process runs off the bottom of the existing
stack and a new page must be allocated.  The sequence of events when
this happens to a UNIX process is as follows:
<p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li> The process takes an access violation, because it accesses an
       address below the current bottom of the stack for which no page
       has been defined.
       <p>
  <li> The kernel determines if the access violation is really a page
       fault.  If so, it brings the page in from the swap area and
       resumes the process.
       <p>
  <li> Failing this, the access violation can mean one of two things:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <p>
	 <li> An access has occured to a page that has been paged out.
	      <p>
	 <li> The stack (or the heap) needs to be grown.
	      <p>
	 <li> The program has an error, and has just dereferenced a
	      pointer to a random place.
       </ul>
       <p> To decide between the last two cases, the kernel checks to
       see if the access has happened within a threshold distance of
       some existing memory region that is marked as ``growing'' in
       the appropriate direction.
       <p>
  <li> Assuming that the access is within the stack (or heap), the
       kernel now allocates a page out of the swap area and maps it
       into the process address space.  It is possible that none is
       available, in which case the UNIX system enters a crisis mode
       and invokes a variety of subsidiary policies to attempt (and
       usually fail) to recover.
       <p>
  <li> Assuming a page has been found, the kernel grows the stack (or
       heap) region to reflect the addition of a new page.
       <p>
  <li> The page is cleared, to prevent other user's data from becoming
       available to the running program.
       <p>
  <li> Finally, the process is restarted, now with a valid page.
</ol>
<p> When a program running under EROS reaches the end of it's current
stack, here is the sequence of events:
<p>
<ol>
  <p>
  <li> The process takes an access violation, because it accesses an
       address below the current bottom of the stack for which no page
       has been defined.
       <p>
  <li> The kernel determines if the access violation is really a page
       fault.  If so, it brings the page in from the swap area and
       resumes the process.
       <p>
  <li> Failing this, the kernel sends a message to the segment keeper
       that includes a key which will enable the segment keeper to
       restart the process.
</ol>
<p> The difference is more than a matter of an extra four steps.  The
UNIX approach requires substantial pieces of code to manage such
things as memory regions, swap space allocation, and crisis recovery
that EROS does not need.
<h1>3 Per-Process State</h1>
<p> A common practice in operating system design is for each process
to have it's own kernel stack.  When a process enters the kernel, it
executes on this stack.  In some operating systems, it is possible for
a process to be rescheduled while in the kernel.
<p> For a variety of reasons, EROS does not take this approach.
Processes that are in the kernel often carry critical state in
hard-to-find places, and may hold locks that block other processes.
Indeed, systems that reschedule programs that are running in the
kernel must take special care to release and reaquire any locks that
the process may hold.
<p> Instead, EROS is designed to that all system service invocations
can be restarted.  If a process performs a read operation by invoking
a page key, for example, and the page is not in memory, the kernel
will initiate an I/O operation to bring in the page and cause the
process to be stalled until the I/O operation completes.
<p> <!--
FIX: A stalled process, conceptually, is <em>not</em> in the
kernel.  It's program counter points to the trap instruction that
caused the system call.  When the process is restarted, it will
perform the service call again, enter the kernel, and this time
discover that the page is in memory.  Since the page is in memory the
process will be able to proceed without further delay.  -->
<h1>4 Static Allocation</h1>
<p> At startup, the kernel partitions system resources and allocates
driver storage.
<p> Remaining space is used for bookkeeping or cacheing.
<p> Problem with this is ``Plug and Play.''
