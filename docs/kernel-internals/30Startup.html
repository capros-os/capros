<p> This chapter describes the system startup procedure for the EROS
system...
<h1>1 System Bootstrap</h1>
<h1>2 Loading the Kernel</h1>
<h1>3 Kernel Initialization</h1>
<h1>4 Autoconfiguration</h1>
<h1>5 Volume Discovery</h1>
<h1>6 Allocating Memory</h1>
<p> When EROS starts up, it performs some machine initialization and
then divides memory into a few distinct areas:

    <p> <strong>Main memory layout</strong>
</center>
<p> The amount of storage allocated by drivers depends on the drivers
themselves, but the remaining areas are fixed size independent of the
machine's available memory.  After drivers have had a chance to
reserve working storage, the kernel then reserves space for the
process list, the domain cache, and the checkpoint log directories.
All remaining storage is used for pages and nodes.  The end result is
that a machine with 8 megabytes (2048 pages) of physical memory holds
1726 pages of user data and 1752 nodes.
<p> If you check the arithmetic, you will find that it doesn't add up.
A node takes up 208 bytes, so adding up all the pieces mentioned so
far, we would get:

    </tr>
    <tr valign=top>
      <td>
	<strong>Total</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
	1996 pages
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> What happened to the missing 52 pages?
<p> Pages and nodes both carry a certain amount of associated
overhead.  This information is kept in a 48 byte structure known as
the <strong>object header</strong>.  Every page and node has an
associated object header.  Because the hardware requires pages to
begin at page boundaries in physical memory, the object headers for
page frames are kept in a separate, parallel structure known as the
<strong>core table</strong>.  The object header for a node is simply
concatenated onto the node itself, so the size of a node is really 256
bytes.
<p> Because the EROS kernel creates memory mapping structures that
depend on the content of node slots, it is necessary to keep track of
the dependencies.  This is done in another structure known as the
<strong>depend table</strong>.  Empirically, we have found that things
work best if there are two depend table entries per node.  Each depend
table entry requires 12 bytes of storage.
<p> Also because of the page allignment constraints, the computation
isn't performed quite as the table seems to indicate.  From the
original 2048 pages, the kernel reserved storage is removed, leaving
1866 pages available.  92.5% of this, or 1726 pages, is then allocated
to the page cache, leaving 140 pages of remaining storage.  This
remaining storage is allocated bytewise.
<p> 140 pages is 573,440 bytes.  The core table is allocated first.
It requires 48 bytes for each page in the page cache, or 82,848 bytes.
Each node takes up 256 bytes for the node proper, plus an additional
24 bytes for the associated depend entries.  The remaining 490,592
bytes is therefore divided by 280 to determine how many nodes the
system will contain, giving 1752.  The nodes are allocated from this
space, leaving 42,008 bytes of available storage to be used by the
depend table (1750 entries).
<p> If this all sounds complicated now, imagine how much fun it was to
puzzle it out the first time through!  Aside from getting the
arithmetic right, the computation itself is fairly straightforward.
