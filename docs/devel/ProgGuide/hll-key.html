	    This note describes the support mechanisms provided to
	    enable C and C++ programs to manipulate capabilities.  All 
	    of the current EROS libraries are built using these
	    conventions.
	  </p>
	  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
	  <p>
	    Higher level languages such as C and C++.  do not directly
	    support capabilities as a standard datatype.  While it is
	    possible to extend these languages, such an extension
	    represents a significant departure from the runtime
	    expectations of existing programs.  Instead, the current
	    EROS programming environment has adopted a compromise
	    using a combination of preprocessor facilities and
	    compiler extensions.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1.1 Slot References</h2>
	  <p>
	    The EROS capability support mechanism provides a data type
	    for capability <em>slot references</em>.  Every capability 
	    resides in a slot, and a slot reference names that slot.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two capability
	    slot types are provided:
	  </p>
	  <table>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td>
		<b>global</b>
	      </td>
	      <td>
		<p>
		  A global slot represents an object that is used
		  throughout the program.  A global slot can be
		  mentioned by name at any point in the application.
		</p>
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr valign=top>
	      <td>
		<b>temporary</b>
	      </td>
	      <td>
		<p>
		  A temporary slot can be used by a library routine
		  that needs a place to put capabilities that are the
		  interim results of computations.  These names of
		  these slots follow the scoping rules of the
		  language, but the slots themselves remain allocated
		  <em>until the procedure exits</em>.
		</p>
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	  <p>
	    Both types of slot references can be passed as arguments
	    to library routines, but procedures are not permitted to
	    return them as results or to copy one slot reference to
	    another.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1.2 The Key Cache Library</h2>
	  <p>
	    The key cache library provides an optional tool for
	    managing large numbers of capabilities.  EROS processes
	    have 31 effective capability registers (capability
	    register zero cannot be modified).  For many applications
	    this is ample.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Other applications must support a larger number of
	    capabilities.  The Key Cache Library transparently
	    multiplexes this larger number of capability slots onto
	    the available capability registers, allowing the
	    application to be written as though a large number of
	    capabilities were directly available.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because the EROS runtime libraries are written using the
	    capability slot data type, they transparently take
	    advantage of the key cache if it is present.
	  </p>
	  <h2>2.  C and C++ Interface</h2>
	  <p>
	    The C/C++ interface for capability slots involves three
	    declarations and three new procedure calls.  
	  </p>
	  <h3>2.1  Slot Declarations</h3>
	  <p>
	    The declarations are:
	  </p>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>
	      <strong>DEF_SLOT(name)</strong>
	      <br>
	      <strong>DEF_SLOT(name, regno)</strong>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p>
		Defines a new slot, and a reference to that slot
		called <em>name</em>.  If the optional register number
		is provided, the capability can initially be found in
		register <em>regno</em>.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This declaration can only be used at file scope.
	      </p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
	      <strong>DECL_SLOT(name)</strong>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p>
		Provides an external declaration for a slot that has
		been defined elsewhere in the application.  This is
		similar to an <code>extern</code> declaration, and
		allows a single slot reference to be used in multiple
		files.  It is an error to define two slots with the
		same name in the same application; slots do not
		conform to the usual rules about the C and C++
		``common'' areas.
	      </p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
	      <strong>TEMP_SLOT(name)</strong>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p>
		Declares a slot that is local to the declaring
		procedure.  A currently unused slot number is
		allocated and bound to <em>name</em>.  The identifier
		<em>name</em> remains in scope according to the usual
		C/C++ scoping rules.  The actual slot is not released
		until the procedure returns.
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		  <p>
		    <em>The peculiarity of the slot release timing is
		    an artifact of the implementation of
		    <b>TEMP_SLOT</b>.  The runtime mechanism records
		    the stack pointer of the procedure that allocated
		    the slot.  It later compares this recorded stack
		    pointer to the current stack pointer to determine
		    of the slot has been freed.  Optimizing compilers
		    go to some lenghts to avoid frequent adjustments
		    to the stack pointer, so the scope of the
		    allocation is not quite the same as the scope of
		    the label.</em>
		  </p>
	      </ul>
	      <p>
		The <b>TEMP_SLOT</b> mechanism provides a ``holding
		slot'' for interim results.  As an example, a routine
		that creates a new process and returns a start
		capability to it must briefly hold both the start
		capability and the process capability to that process.
		This means that it requires a place to store the
		process capability that will not clobber a capability
		that is actively in use.  The <b>temp_slot</b>
		declaration is intended for this purpose.
	      </p>
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	  <h3>2.2  Procedures</h3>
	  <p>
	    The three new procedures are <b>KCALL</b>, <b>KRETURN</b>,
	    and <b>KSEND</b>.  Where the CALL, RETURN, and SEND
	    procedures use a low-level message format, the KCALL,
	    KRETURN, and KSEND procedures provide the binding layer
	    between slot references and the capability registers in
	    order for the invocation to succeed.  KCALL, KSEND, and
	    KRETURN resolve the slots to registers and then invoke the
	    lower-level primitives.
	  </p>
	  <h2>3. Typical Usage</h2>
	  <p>
	    C and C++ code that wishes to use this interface should
	    first include
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <code>#include &lt;domain/keyslot.h&gt</code>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    For native EROS applications, some of the key registers will
	    initially contain values placed there by the constructor.
	    Most applications will therefore wish to include the
	    following declarations in the main source code file:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	      <pre>
DEF_SLOT(constituents, 1);   /* process constituents node */
DEF_SLOT(self, 2);           /* domain key to this process */
DEF_SLOT(proccre, 3);        /* our process creator */
DEF_SLOT(mybank, 4);         /* our space bank */
DEF_SLOT(mysched, 5);        /* our schedule capability */
DEF_SLOT(caller, 31);        /* resume key to our caller */
	      </pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    Applications that wish to accept capability arguments as
	    part of their invocations may also wish to declare:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	      <pre>
DEF_SLOT(arg1);              /* process constituents node */
DEF_SLOT(arg2);              /* domain key to this process */
DEF_SLOT(arg3);              /* our process creator */
	      </pre>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    As an example of TEMP_SLOT, consider the
	    <code>lwp_start</code> library routine, which releases a
	    new lightweight process to run:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	      <pre>
uint32_t lwp_start(KeySlot lwp /* a domain key */)
{
  uint32_t result;
  TEMP_SLOT(lwp_fault);
  KMessage km;

  result = process_make_waiting(lwp, lwp_fault /* OUT */);
  if (result != RC_OK)
    return result;

  km.snd_len = 0;
  km.snd_slot0 = KR_ZERO;
  km.snd_slot1 = KR_ZERO;
  km.snd_slot2 = KR_ZERO;
  km.snd_slot3 = KR_ZERO;
  km.snd_code = RC_OK;
  km.snd_invSlot = lwp_fault;

  KSEND(&km);
  return RC_OK;
}
	      </pre>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>4.  Special Situations</h2>
	  <p>
	    A special situation arises in the case where a program is
	    converting itself into another program by replacing its
	    address space.  The recipient program usually will have
	    embedded assumptions about which of its initial
	    capabilities are in what registers.  These assumptions
	    must be satisfied by the original program before invoking
	    the target program.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This can be accomplished by means of the <b>BIND_SLOT</b>
	    call:
	  </p>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>
	      <strong>BIND_SLOT(name, regno)</strong>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p>
		Given a slot named by <em>name</em>, cause the
		corresponding capability to be moved to <em>regno</em>
		if it is not already there.  If the register
		<em>regno</em> is currently bound to some other slot
		name <em>name2</em>, this is accomplished by swapping
		both the capabilities and the slots of the two
		capabilities.  Thus, if <em>name1</em> is currently
		bound to <em>reg1</em>, and <em>name2</em> is
		currently bound to <em>reg2</em>, and the call
		<code>BIND_SLOT(name1, reg2)</code> is made, the
		effect is to exchange the two registers, rebind
		<em>name1</em> to <em>reg2</em> and rebind
		<em>name2</em> to <em>reg1</em>.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This is a long-winded way of saying the values are
		swapped.
	      </p>
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	  <p>
	    It is therefore possible to achieve explicit placement of
	    capabilities in desired registers by appropriate calls to
	    BIND_SLOT.
	  </p>

	      </td>
	      <td>
		<p>
		  Any subsequent call to KCALL, KRETURN, or KSEND is
		  entitled to rearrange the capability registers, so
		  the slot bindings do not remain in effect across
		  such calls.
