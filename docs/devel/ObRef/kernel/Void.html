	    <h3>Description</h3> 
	    <p> 
	      The <strong>Void</strong> object is the unique singleton
	      object that returns <b>RC_Void</b> to all requests.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The <strong>Void</strong> key occurs whenever a key
	      register or node slot holds no other key. Void keys are
	      created in a variety of ways:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		When a Node is created, all slots contain void keys.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		The Clear Node operation on a Node stores void keys in
		all slots of the node.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		When an object is destroyed, all outstanding keys to
		that object are replaced with void keys. This
		conversion may occur at any time, but it is guaranteed
		to occur before such a key is invoked.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		When a resume key is invoked, all outstanding resume
		keys to the same process are replaced with void
		keys. This conversion may occur at any time, but it is
		guaranteed to occur before such a key is invoked.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      The void key returns <b>RC_Void</b> to all requests. By
	      (strong) convention, the <b>RC_Void</b> return code is
	      generally avoided by other objects in order to allow
	      callers to discern when an object has been destroyed.
