  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> Several aspects of the EROS design rest on the notion that an
  operation is <strong>prompt</strong>.  We say that an operation is
  prompt if its execution time is entirely under the control of the
  kernel.  Examples of prompt operations include:
  <ul>
    <li> All invocations of kernel objects.
	 <p> 
    <li> Operations on primary objects that do not result in keeper
	 invocations (page faults are considered prompt).  While the
	 kernel cannot guarantee that these operations are prompt, a
	 user who knows by design that the invocations will not cause
	 a keeper invocation may rely on their promptness.
	 <p>
  </ul>
  <p> Process invocations are not prompt.  Invocations on device keys
  may or may not be prompt.
