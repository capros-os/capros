  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> <img src="../../../img/construction.gif" align=left> This
  description is still under construction.
  <br clear=left>
  <p> The EROS kernel implements a two-level scheduling mechanism.
  The first tier is a scheduler based on processor capacity reserves
  [<a href="#mercer">Mercer93</a>], while the second is
  a conventional priority scheduling system.  Every process contains a
  <a href=../primary/SchedClass.html>Schedule Key</a> under which it
  runs.  Schedules come in three varieties:
  <ul>
    <li> A <em>reserve</em> schedule owns the processor during the
	 time period defined by its processor capacity reserve, but
	 does not authorize execution at any other time.
	 <p> 	 
    <li> A <em>hybrid</em> schedule combines a reserve and a priority.
	 Hybrid schedules own the processor during the time period
	 defined by its processor capacity reserve, and allows the
	 process to run at the specified priority when no reserve is
	 active.
	 <p> 	 
    <li> A <em>priority</em> schedule enables its process to run at
	 the specified priority when no reserve is active.
	 <p>
  </ul>
  <p> When a capacity reserve is in control of the processor and a
  program operating under that schedule is ready to run, that process
  will gain control of the processor.  If no process is ready to run,
  or if no reserve is in control of the processor, cycles are
  allocated according to priority.  Within a priority class, processes
  are executed in round-robin fashion.
  <h4>Processor Capacity Reserves</h4>
  <p> A <strong>processor capacity reserve</strong> is defined by two
  values: a <em>duration</em> (<strong>D</strong>) indicating how much
  computation time is required, and a <em>period</em>
  (<strong>P</strong>) describing how often this duration must be made
  available.  The EROS scheduler assumes that activities are
  preemtable provided that the requirements of their reserves are met.
  In consequence, both the duration and the period impact the
  scheduling of the process.  A (3 tick,10 tick) reserve and a (30
  tick, 100 tick) reserve both allocate 30% of the processor, but the
  variance permitted by the second reserve is much higher.
  <blockquote>
    <p> <img src="../../../img/construction.gif" align=left> <em>I am
    contemplating altering the reserve abstraction to define a
    duration, active period, and inactive period in order to
    facilitate jitter control.  It is not clear if this is an
    improvement.</em> <br clear=all>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Once a reserve has been successfully allocated, the holder is
  entitled to <strong>D</strong> ticks out of every <strong>P</strong>
  ticks.  Once these guaranteed ticks have been consumed, they are not
  replenished until the period <strong>P</strong> has expired.
  Depending on the reserve, the process may elect to run
  opportunistically on a priority basis during the remainder of its
  period.  Guaranteed ticks are always consumed in preference to
  opportunistic ticks.
  <p> Multiple processes may run under the same reserve.  Runnable
  processes within a reserve are initiated in FIFO order. Once
  activated, a process running under a reserve will continue until the
  reserve runs out or the process performs some action causing it to
  yield.  A process yields when:
  <ul>
    <li> It performs a non-prompt action, such as touching a page that
	 must be faulted in from the disk.  Under normal
	 circumstances, a real-time program will operate under one or
	 more <a href="WorkingSets.html">working set</a> reserves,
	 limiting this impact to startup overhead and/or explicit I/O.
    <li> It performs a <strong>Call</strong>, <strong>Return</strong>,
	 or <strong>Send</strong> to a process that is not entitled to
	 execute under the same reserve.
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <img src="../../../img/construction.gif" align=left>
    <em>Should reserves have a preemption </em>quanta<em> defining
    when its active process should be rotated?  Would doing so
    provide neater integration of reserves and preemption?</em> <br
    clear=all>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In order to be eligable for guaranteed ticks during a given
  period, the process must be in the <em>running</em> state at the
  beginning of that period.  If a process running under a reserve
  <strong>R</strong> invokes another process entitled to run under the
  same reserve <strong>R</strong>, the behavior depends on the type of
  the invocation:
  <ul>
    <table width="85%">
      <tr valign=top>
	<th align=left>Invocation</th>
	<th align=left>Action</th>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td><strong>Call</strong></td>
	<td>Control flow passes to the invokee without preeption, unless
	  the reserve's period expires in mid-call.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td><strong>Return</strong></td>
	<td>Control flow passes to the invokee without preeption, unless
	  the reserve's period expires in mid-call.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td><strong>Send</strong></td>
	<td>Control flow continues with the invokee without
	  preemption.  The invoker is placed at the tail of the
	  activation queue for the reserve (i.e. in the last-in
	  position).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <img src="../../../img/construction.gif" align=left> <em>There
    is an open issue concerning whether we need to add an</em>
    <strong>Activate</strong> <em>invocation, in which control flow
    continues with the invokee and the invoker is placed at the tail
    of the FIFO.  It's a nearly trivial addition, and I would
    appreciate feedback on whether it is needed.  My guess is that the
    use of the</em> <strong>Send</strong> <em>primitive in real-time
    programs should be fairly minimal.  Come to think of it, the </em>
    <strong>Activate</strong> <em>Primitive would appear to be
    necessary in the ethernet packet filter to ensure that a packet
    destined for multiple protocol stacks is delivered to all of them
    in time to ensure that they get a fair shot at executing within
    their reserve period.</em> <br clear=all>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Reserve Management</h4>
  <p> Processor reserves are allocated and managed by the <a
  href="../standard/ReserveAgent.html">Reserve Agent</a>, which in
  turn holds a <a href="../kernel/SchedCreator.html">Schedule
  Creator</a> key. Given a
  request for a processor capacity reserve, the reserve agent either
  constructs the requested reserve and returns a schedule key to it,
  or indicates that the reserve cannot be constructed.  The reserve
  agent in turn makes use of the primitive kernel reserve mechanism to
  support the schedules it issues.
  <p> Certain system processes, including the login agent and the
  prime space bank, run under a pre-allocated reserve.  This reserve
  grants 5ms out of every 200ms, and is generally underutilized.  The
  purpose of this reserve is to ensure that an administrator desiring
  to log in to the system will be able to do so.  <br clear=left>
  <p> The current kernel implementation of reserves is based on a
  fixed-priority mechanism.  This strategy was easy to implement, and
  allows up to 69% of the total processing capacity to be allocated to
  reserved tasks. While this should be be sufficient for the programs
  we currently anticipate, future implementations may switch to
  dynamic reprioritization using an earliest deadline first (EDF)
  algorithm.
  <h4>Priorities</h4>
  <p>In addition to the capacity reserve mechanism, the EROS kernel
  implements a conventional priority scheduler.  A process may run
  under a reserve, under a given priority, or both.  Processes
  entitled to time under a reserve are dispatched in preference to
  priority based execution.  Within a priority level, processes are
  dispatched in round-robin fashion according to a system-defined
  quanta.  In all current implementations, the priority scheduling
  quanta is approximately 10 ms.  The accuracy of quanta expiration is
  subject to the limits of the underlying hardware.
  <p> EROS provides 16 priority levels.  The conventional
  interpretation of these priorities is:
  <ul>
    <table width="85%">
      <tr>
	<th align=left>Value</th>
	<th align=left>Name</th>
	<th align=left>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td>16</td>
	<td>High</td>
	<td>Process will run in preference to all lower priority
	  processes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>Normal</td>
	<td>The priority level assigned to most interactive processes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>Idle</td>
	<td>Process will run only when there is nothing better to do.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </ul>
  <p> A schedule key conveying the authority to run at a given
  priority conveys the authority to fabricate schedule keys conveying
  lesser or equal priority.  Processes with access to their own
  schedule key are thereby able to construct other processes having
  lesser priority.
