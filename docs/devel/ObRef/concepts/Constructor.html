  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> EROS is designed as a client/serv<em>ice</em>} system.  Except
  where shared state or multiplexing are required, each client
  receives it's own instance of any service that it uses.
  <strong>Constructors</strong> are trusted agents (programs) that
  build service instances.
  <p> More generally, constructors provide the means by which mutually
  suspicious parties can collaborate.  A <em>service provider</em>
  acquires a new constructor (which is fabricated by the
  <strong>MetaConstructor</strong>), and installs into this new
  constructor the capabilities that the service instances should
  initially hold.  The provider then <em>seals</em> the constructor,
  whereupon a distinguished start capability known as a
  <strong>requestor capability</strong> is returned.
  <p> Programs built by constructors can be characterized as
  <em>discreet</em> or <em>indiscreet</em>.  A discreet program is one
  that provably cannot leak information to a third party.  Such a
  program's faults cannot propagate to other programs.  Discretion is
  ascertained by construction. As each capability is installed in the
  constructor, the constructor examines the discretion of that
  capability.  The installed capability is either:
  <p> 
  <ul>
    <li> A <em>discreet</em> capability, such as a read-only address space
	 capability,
    <li> An <em>indiscreet</em> capability, such as a read-write address
	 space capability, or
    <li> The product of another constructor, whose discretion can be
	 ascertained by asking that constructor.
  </ul>
  <p> Constructors are able to certify the authenticity of other
  constructors, and that any space used to construct program instances
  comes from a trusted source of storage.  Because the constructor is
  a trusted agent, a client can be sure that their data will not be
  leaked, and that the constructed service cannot consume all
  available client resources.
  <p> For purposes of active networking, the role played by
  constructors is the confinement of suspicious programs.  While
  cryptographic signatures can be used to certify programs by previous
  arrangement, the provenance of a netlet in general is unknown, and
  the active node must presume that such netlets are potentially
  hostile.  The solution is to place the incoming netlet inside a
  confinement boundary, minimizing mischievious missionism.
