	    <h3>Description</h3>
	    <p>
	      A sensory key is similar to (in some cases identical
	      with) a read-only key, with the additional property that
	      all keys obtained through it will be weakened to sensory
	      authority.  This provides a way to hand a client a key
	      to an object and ensure that all of the objects that are
	      <em>transitively</em> reachable through the initial key
	      will be immutable to the client.  A sensory key conveys
	      no authority to modify the designated object.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The sensory version of a key is defined as follows:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The sensory version of a node key is a node key to
		  the same node with the same key info field, except
		  that the no-call, read-only, and weak attributes are
		  guaranteed to be set.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The sensory version of an address space key is a
		  read-only, no-call, weak version of the address
		  space key.  </p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The sensory version of a number key is the same key.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  The sensory version of a page key is a read-only
		  page key to the same page.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  The sensory version of the <a
		  href="../kernel/Discrim.html"><strong>discrim</strong></a>
		  key is the same key.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  The sensory version of all other keys is the <a
		  href="../kernel/Void.html"><strong>void
		  key</strong></a>.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      A significant difference between EROS and previous
	      systems implementing this facility is that sensory keys
	      are easily obtained.
