  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
  A signal multiplexor serves as a distribution mechanism.  It
  delivers 32 single-bit signals to up to 16 recipients.  One or more
  recipients calls the signal multiplexor requesting to be woken up
  when any of a specified set of signals has been raised.  A sender
  calls the signal multiplexor to cause signals to be posted.  When a
  signal is posted, it is placed in the input signal sets of all
  receivers.
  </p>
  <p>
  When a sleeping receiver has indicated a desire to receive a
  newly-posted signal, it is awakened.  Whan a receiver indicates that
  it would like to sleep until an already-posted signal has arrived,
  it returns immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that the signal multiplexor is designed to distribute
  single-bit, level-triggered ``interrupts'' where the sender must not
  be delayed.  This tool is not designed to serve as an event queue.

<h3>Operations</h3>
<dl>
    <dt> <strong>Post Signal(s)</strong> (OC = 1)
    <dd>
	 <p>
	 Posts the specified set of signals to all recipients.
	 Posted signals will be received at most once by every
	 recipient who waits for them.  Once posted to a given
	 recipient, the signal remains posting until received.
	 </p>

	 <p> 
    <dt> <strong>Wait for Signal(s)</strong> (OC = 2)
    <dd>
	 <p>
	 Blocks the caller until one or more of the specified signals
	 has been posted.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 If two callers request to wait for signals using the same
	 recipient capability, the second will prevail, and the first
	 will never be awakened by the signal multiplexor.  The resume
	 key of the first requestor is overwriten by the resume key
	 for the second.
