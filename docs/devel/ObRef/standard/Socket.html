  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p> Networks don't really exist.  They are a figment of some poor
  Steve Muir's imagination.  The bits actually move from one machine
  to the other by magic; the physical infrastructure merely serves to
  establish the appropriate preconditions for belief in magic on the
  part of the users.
  <p> <em>Note that the UNIX-isms have not yet been cleaned out of
  this page.</em>
  <p> The <strong>Network Socket</strong> object encapsulates all of
  the necessary functionality build and use network connections to
  either remote or local hosts.  The current object interface is based
  closely on the <strong>UNIX</strong> system call interface for
  sockets, and was chosen for speed of implementation rather than for
  the merits of the interface.  In some places the function of the
  UNIX system calls should probably be merged into a single request.
  <p> A <strong>Network Socket</strong> object has the following
  internal states:
  <ul>
    <table width=90%>
      <tr valign=top>
	<th align=left>State</th>
	<th align=left>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td><em>Unbound</em></td>
	<td>Not bound to any particular network interface.  May be

      </tr>
      <tr valign=top>
	<td><em>Bound</em></td>
	<td>Bound by a connect or bind operation.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>    
  </ul>
  <p> Every socket has an associated <em>process</em> (protocol
  family), <em>type</em>, and <em>protocol</em>. The supported
  protocol families are:
  <p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p> A <strong>SOCK_STREAM</strong> type provides sequenced,
  reliable, two-way connection based byte streams.  An out-of-band
  data transmission mechanism may be supported.  A
  <strong>SOCK_DGRAM</strong> socket supports datagrams
  (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small)
  maximum length).  A <strong>SOCK_SEQPACKET</strong> socket may
  provide a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data
  transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer
  may be required to read an entire packet with each read system call.
  This facility is protocol specific, and presently implemented only
  for <strong>AF_NS</strong>.  <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong> sockets
  provide access to internal network protocols and interfaces.  The
  types <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong>, which is available only to the
  super-user, and <strong>SOCK_RDM</strong>, which is planned, but not
  yet implemented, are not described here.
  <p> The <em>protocol</em> specifies a particular protocol to be used
  with the socket.  Normally only a single protocol exists to support
  a particular socket type within a given protocol family.  However,
  it is possible that many protocols may exist, in which case a
  particular protocol must be specified in this manner.  The protocol
  number to use is particular to the ``communication process'' in which
  communication is to take place.
  <p> Sockets of type <strong>SOCK_STREAM</strong> are full-duplex
  byte streams, similar to pipes. A stream socket must be in a
  <em>connected</em> state before any data may be sent or received on
  it. A connection to another socket is created with a <A
  HREF="#connect">connect</A> invocation. Once connected, data may be
  transferred using <A HREF="#read">read</A> and <A
  HREF="#write">write</A> invocations or <A HREF="#send">send</a> and <a
  HREF="#recv">recv</a> invocations.  When a session has been completed a
  <A HREF="#close">close</A> invocation should be performed.
  <p> Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described in <A
  HREF="#send">send</A> and received as described in <A
  HREF="#recv">recv</A>.
  <P> The communications protocols used to implement a
  <strong>SOCK_STREAM</strong> insure that data is not lost or
  duplicated.  If a piece of data for which the peer protocol has
  buffer space cannot be successfully transmitted within a reasonable
  length of time, then the connection is considered broken and calls
  will indicate an error with -1 returns and with
  <strong>ETIMEDOUT</strong> as the specific code in the global
  variable <em>errno</em>. The protocols optionally keep sockets
  <em>warm</em> by forcing transmissions roughly every minute in the
  absence of other activity. An error is then indicated if no response
  can be elicited on an otherwise idle connection for a extended
  period (e.g. 5 minutes). A <strong>SIGPIPE</strong> signal is raised
  if a process sends on a broken stream; this causes naive processes,
  which do not handle the signal, to exit.
  <P> <strong>SOCK_SEQPACKET</strong> sockets employ the same system
  calls as <strong>SOCK_STREAM</strong> sockets. The only difference
  is that <A HREF="#read">read</A> calls will return only the
  amount of data requested, and any remaining in the arriving packet
  will be discarded.
  <P> <strong>SOCK_DGRAM</strong> and <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong>
  sockets allow sending of datagrams to correspondents named in <A
  HREF="#send">send</A> calls. Datagrams are generally received
  with <A HREF="#recvfrom">recvfrom</A>, which returns the next
  datagram with its return address.
  <P> A <A HREF="#control">control</A> invocation can be used to
  specify a process group to receive a <strong>SIGURG</strong> signal
  when the out-of-band data arrives.  It may also enable non-blocking
  I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events via
  <strong>SIGIO</strong>.
  <P> The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level
  <em>options</em>.  These options are defined in the file
  <em>socket.h</em>. <A HREF="#setsockopt">Setsockopt</A> and <A
  HREF="#getsockopt">getsockopt</A> are used to set and get
  options, respectively.
  <P><hr>

<center><strong>Socket Options</strong></center>

<P>
	 The following options are recognized at the socket level.
	 Except as noted, each may be examined with <B>getsockopt</B> and
         set with <B>setsockopt</B>.
       </DD>
<B>SO_DEBUG</B> enables debugging in the underlying protocol modules.
<B>SO_REUSEADDR</B> indicates that the rules used in validating
addresses supplied in a <B>bind</B> call should allow
reuse of local addresses. <B>SO_KEEPALIVE</B> enables the periodic
transmission of messages on a connected socket.
Should the connected party fail to respond to these
messages, the connection is considered broken and processes
using the socket are notified via a <B>SIGPIPE</B> signal
when attempting to send data. <B>SO_DONTROUTE</B> indicates that
outgoing messages should bypass the standard routing
facilities. Instead, messages are directed to the appropriate
network interface according to the network portion
of the destination address. 
<P>
<B>SO_LINGER</B> controls the action taken when unsent messages
are queued on socket and a <B>close</B> is performed. If the
socket promises reliable delivery of data and <B>SO_LINGER</B> <B>is</B>
<B>set,</B> the system will block the process on the <B>close</B>
attempt until it is able to transmit the data or until it
decides it is unable to deliver the information (a timeout
period, termed the linger interval, is specified in the
<B>setsockopt</B> call when <B>SO_LINGER</B> is requested). If
<B>SO_LINGER</B> is disabled and a <B>close</B> is issued, the system
will process the close in a manner that allows the process
to continue as quickly as possible.
<P>
The option <B>SO_BROADCAST</B> requests permission to send broadcast
datagrams on the socket. Broadcast was a privileged
operation in earlier versions of the system. With protocols
that support out-of-band data, the <B>SO_OOBINLINE</B>
option requests that out-of-band data be placed in the
normal data input queue as received; it will then be
accessible with <B>recv</B> or <B>read</B> calls without the <B>MSG_OOB</B>
flag. Some protocols always behave as if this option is
set. <B>SO_SNDBUF</B> and <B>SO_RCVBUF</B> are options to adjust the
normal buffer sizes allocated for output and input 
buffers, respectively. The buffer size may be increased
for high-volume connections, or may be decreased to limit
the possible backlog of incoming data. The system places
an absolute limit on these values.
<P>
<B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is an option to set the minimum count for output
operations. Most output operations process all of the
data supplied by the call, delivering data to the protocol
for transmission and blocking as necessary for flow control.   
Nonblocking output operations will process as much
data as permitted subject to flow control without blocking,
but will process no data if flow control does not
allow the smaller of the low water mark value or the
entesting the ability to write to a socket will return true
only if the low water mark amount could be processed. The
default value for <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is set to a convenient size
for network efficiency, often 1024. <B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B> is an
option to set the minimum count for input operations. In
general, receive calls will block until any (non-zero)
amount of data is received, then return with smaller of
the amount available or the amount requested. The default
value for <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is 1. If <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is set to a
larger value, blocking receive calls normally wait until
they have received the smaller of the low water mark value
or the requested amount. Receive calls may still return
less than the low water mark if an error occurs, a signal
is caught, or the type of data next in the receive queue
is different than that returned.
<P>
<B>SO_SNDTIMEO</B> is an option to set a timeout value for output
operations. It accepts a <I>struct</I> <I>timeval</I> parameter with
the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits
for output operations to complete. If a send operation
has blocked for this much time, it returns with a partial
count or with the error <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B> if no data were sent.   
In the current implementation, this timer is restarted
each time additional data are delivered to the protocol,  
implying that the limit applies to output portions ranging     
in size from the low water mark to the high water mark for
output. <B>SO_RCVTIMEO</B> is an option to set a timeout value
for input operations. It accepts a <I>struct</I> <I>timeval</I> parameter
with the number of seconds and microseconds used to 
limit waits for input operations to complete. In the current
tire request to be processed. A <B>select</B> operation
testing the ability to write to a socket will return true
only if the low water mark amount could be processed. The
default value for <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is set to a convenient size
for network efficiency, often 1024. <B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B> is an
option to set the minimum count for input operations. In
general, receive calls will block until any (non-zero)
amount of data is received, then return with smaller of
the amount available or the amount requested. The default
value for <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is 1. If <B>SO_SNDLOWAT</B> is set to a
larger value, blocking receive calls normally wait until
they have received the smaller of the low water mark value
or the requested amount. Receive calls may still return
less than the low water mark if an error occurs, a signal
is caught, or the type of data next in the receive queue
is different than that returned.
<P>
<B>SO_SNDTIMEO</B> is an option to set a timeout value for output
operations. It accepts a <I>struct</I> <I>timeval</I> parameter with
the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits
for output operations to complete. If a send operation
has blocked for this much time, it returns with a partial
count or with the error <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B> if no data were sent.   
In the current implementation, this timer is restarted
each time additional data are delivered to the protocol,  
implying that the limit applies to output portions ranging     
in size from the low water mark to the high water mark for
output. <B>SO_RCVTIMEO</B> is an option to set a timeout value
for input operations. It accepts a <I>struct</I> <I>timeval</I> parameter
with the number of seconds and microseconds used to 
limit waits for input operations to complete. In the current
implementation, this timer is restarted each time
additional data are received by the protocol, and thus the
limit is in effect an inactivity timer. If a receive
operation has been blocked for this much time without
receiving additional data, it returns with a short count
or with the error <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B> if no data were received.
<P>
Finally, <B>SO_TYPE</B> and <B>SO_ERROR</B> are options used only with
<I>setsockopt</I>. <B>SO_TYPE</B> returns the type of the socket, such
as <B>SOCK_STREAM</B>; it is useful for servers that inherit
sockets on startup. <B>SO_ERROR</B> returns any pending error on
the socket and clears the error status. It may be used to
check for asynchronous errors on connected datagram sockets
or for other asynchronous errors.

		The flags argument to a recv call is formed by or'ing one or more of the values: 
	       	<p>MSG_OOB process out-of-band data 
		<p>MSG_PEEK peek at incoming message 
		<p>MSG_WAITALL wait for full request or error <p>
		The MSG_OOB flag requests receipt of out-of-band data that would not be received 
		in the normal data stream. Some protocols place expedited data at the head of the 
		normal data queue, and thus this flag cannot be used with such protocols. The 
		MSG_PEEK flag causes the receive operation to return data from the beginning of 
		the receive queue without removing that data from the queue. Thus, a subsequent 
		receive call will return the same data. The MSG_WAITALL flag requests that the 
		operation block until the full request is satisfied. However, the call may still 
		return less data than requested if a signal is caught, an error or disconnect 
		occurs, or the next data to be received is of a different type than that returned.
